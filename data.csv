It was as easy as collecting sea shells at Malibu.,ontonotes5
"Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards.",ontonotes5
"Here, wedged between shifting dunes and pounding waves at the world's most inhospitable diamond dig, lies the earth's most precious jewel box.",ontonotes5
"Thanks to centuries of polishing by Mother Nature--first in the gentle current of the Orange River that carried the stones from South Africa's interior, then in the cold surf of the ocean, and finally in the coarse sands of the desert--98% of the diamonds uncovered are of gem quality.",ontonotes5
"Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert--about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic--a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations.",ontonotes5
"When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers.",ontonotes5

Sheraton Corp. and Pan American World Airways announced that they and two Soviet partners will construct two ``world-class'' hotels within a mile of Red Square in Moscow.,ontonotes5
U.S. and Soviet officials hailed the joint project as a new indication of the further thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations.,ontonotes5
"Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who attended the ceremony, called the undertaking a ``historic step'' in the evolution of U.S.-Soviet ties.",ontonotes5
The project will be the largest U.S.-backed joint venture to be undertaken in the Soviet Union in recent years.,ontonotes5
The six-story hotel will be on Gorky Street and initially will cater mostly to business travelers.,ontonotes5
"The second hotel, to be called the Budapest Hotel, is to be constructed at a site even closer to Red Square.",ontonotes5
"The Soviet owners will be Mossoviet, Moscow's city governing body, and Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline.",ontonotes5
"Although a Finnish group has a minority interest in an already operating Moscow hotel, the Sheraton-Pan Am venture will be the first joint-venture hotels in the Soviet Union to have as much as 50% foreign ownership.",ontonotes5
"U.S. companies account for less than 8% of the 1,000 or more Soviet joint ventures that have been announced since the Soviets began encouraging such undertakings in 1987.",ontonotes5

A Japanese apple called the Fuji is cropping up in orchards the way Hondas did on U.S. roads.,ontonotes5
Some fruit visionaries say the Fuji could someday tumble the Red Delicious from the top of America's apple heap.,ontonotes5
"To hear most U.S. growers tell it, we 'd still be in Paradise if the serpent had proffered one to Eve.",ontonotes5
"It has a long shelf life and ``doesn't fool the public ,'' says Grady Auvil, an Orondo, Wash., grower who is planting Fujis and spreading the good word about them.",ontonotes5
"He is known as the father of the U.S.-grown Granny Smith, a radically different apple that the conventional wisdom once said would never catch on.",ontonotes5
"Its roots are patriotic--with the first trees appearing in 1872 in an orchard near Peru, Iowa, to be exact.",ontonotes5
"More than twice as many Red Delicious apples are grown as the Golden variety, America's No. 2 apple.",ontonotes5
"One may be William Broderick, a Sterling, Mass., grower.",ontonotes5
"Though growers can't always keep the worm from the apple, they can protect themselves against the price vagaries of any one variety by diversifying--into the recently imported Gala, a sweet New Zealand native; the Esopus Spitzenburg, reportedly Thomas Jefferson's favorite apple; disease-resistant kinds like the Liberty.",ontonotes5
"``I've ripped out a lot of Delicious'' and grafted the trees with many different shoots, says Steve Wood, a West Lebanon, N.H., grower, tramping through his 100-acre Poverty Lane Orchard on a crisp autumn day recently.",ontonotes5
"``Rather than sell 39-cents-a-pound Delicious, maybe we can sell 79-cents-a-pound Fujis ,'' says Chuck Tryon, perishables director for Super Valu Inc., a Minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor.",ontonotes5
"In the cornucopia of go-go apples, the Fuji's track record stands out: During the past 15 years, it has gone from almost zilch to some 50% of Japan's market.",ontonotes5
"``The Japanese apple market is very keyed to high quality ,'' says David Lane, a scientist at a Canadian horticulture research center in Summerland, British Columbia, and so apples are more of a delicacy there than a big food commodity.",ontonotes5
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that this year Americans will eat about 40% more fresh apples per capita than the Japanese.,ontonotes5
"The Fuji is still small potatoes in the U.S., sold mainly in fruit boutiques.",ontonotes5
"But in California, says Craig Ito, a Fuji-apple grower, ``There's a Fuji apple cult.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Auvil, the Washington grower, says that he could sell Fujis to Taiwan buyers at$ 40 a box if he had them.",ontonotes5
"-LRB- Taiwan already is a big importer of Fujis from other places, he adds. -RRB-",ontonotes5

"The state attorney general's office filed suit against five New York brokerage firms, charging them with responsibility for much of a$ 200 million loss incurred by the state treasurer's office in 1987.",ontonotes5
The firms have all said that West Virginia's suit is without merit.,ontonotes5
"On Friday, the firms filed a suit against West Virginia in New York state court asking for a declaratory judgment absolving them of liability.",ontonotes5
"The suits relate to a$ 200 million loss, disclosed in December, that was suffered by West Virginia's consolidated investment pool.",ontonotes5
"Some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books; as late as 1987, the Export-Import Bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to Cuba in the 1950s.",ontonotes5
The proposal reiterates the U.S. desire to scrap or reduce a host of trade-distorting subsidies on farm products.,ontonotes5
"The U.S. plan also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased out over 10 years.",ontonotes5
"Trade Representative Carla Hills, who along with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter unveiled the proposal, said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the U.S.'s trading partners.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Yeutter, seeking to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that called for eliminating all farm-trade barriers by the year 2000, said the new U.S. proposal wouldn't ``put farmers out of business'' but would only encourage them to ``grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants.''",ontonotes5
"The U.S. is submitting the proposal today in Geneva, hoping that the initiative will spur members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in December 1990.",ontonotes5
"Another U.S. proposal filed Monday urges more ``fair play'' in services trade, including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies.",ontonotes5
"Unlike the earlier U.S. farm-trade proposal which struck European countries as too extreme, the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver.",ontonotes5
"For instance, the new U.S. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which GATT members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition.",ontonotes5
"Instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies, as the earlier U.S. proposal did, the new package calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones.",ontonotes5
The new U.S. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily.,ontonotes5
The goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the European Community's current attempt to bar imports of beef from hormone-treated U.S. cattle.,ontonotes5
The U.S. contends that the rules aren't justified on health grounds.,ontonotes5
"To encourage more competition among exporting countries, the U.S. is proposing that export subsidies, including tax incentives for exporters, be phased out in five years.",ontonotes5
"Examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities--New York and Birmingham, Ala.",ontonotes5
New York City:,ontonotes5
"Racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in New York City since 1970, when Congress first amended the Voting Rights Act to expand its reach beyond the Southern states.",ontonotes5
"In 1972, the Justice Department required that the electoral map in the borough of Brooklyn be redrawn to concentrate black and Hispanic votes, despite protests that the new electoral boundaries would split a neighborhood of Hasidic Jews into two different districts.",ontonotes5
"This year, a commission appointed by the mayor to revise New York's system of government completed a new charter, expanding the City Council to 51 from 35 members.",ontonotes5
"In this connection, it is important to note that several members of New York's sitting City Council represent heterogeneous districts that bring together sizable black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white populations--Carolyn Maloney's 8th district in northern Manhattan and the south Bronx and Susan Alter's 25th district in Brooklyn, for example.",ontonotes5
"Birmingham, Ala.:",ontonotes5
The unusual situation in Birmingham vividly illustrates the divisive consequences of carving out safe districts for racial minorities.,ontonotes5
"No federal court has ruled that the Voting Rights Act protects a white minority, but in June the Justice Department approved a districting plan for Birmingham that carves out three white-majority districts and six black-majority districts.",ontonotes5
"Richard Arrington, Birmingham's black mayor, lamented the consequences.",ontonotes5

"Town & Country Ford in Charlotte, N.C., still needs to move about 850 1989 cars and trucks.",ontonotes5
"The No. 3 U.S. auto maker had a 23.7% plunge in car sales to 22,336 and a 17.5% drop in truck sales to 22,925, which include its minivans and Jeeps.",ontonotes5

The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating.,ontonotes5
"Like Lebanon, and however unfairly, Israel is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration.",ontonotes5
"Like Lebanon, Israel is being remade by demography.",ontonotes5
In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims.,ontonotes5
"Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs nor, says its present prime minister, redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland.",ontonotes5
"Unlike the Maronites, Israel's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut.",ontonotes5
"Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation, for example, is the Krasnoyarsk radar.",ontonotes5
"-- ``Arms Control Reality ,'' Nov. 20, 1984, the first of some 20 Journal editorials saying that Krasnoyarsk violated the ABM treaty.",ontonotes5
"-- The U.S.S.R. has taken unprecedented unilateral measures of openness, by giving American representatives a possibility to inspect the building site of the Krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of Gomel and Moscow, so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the ABM treaty of 1972 on the part of the Soviet Union.",ontonotes5
"We're happy, we guess, to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets, five years after we started writing about it.",ontonotes5
Our own test of ``glasnost's'' authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations--the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk.,ontonotes5
"The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there, and hence a violation of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.",ontonotes5
"The Pentagon's recently issued ``Soviet Military Power ,'' though in general adopting a softer line, repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment.",ontonotes5
It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February: An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths.,ontonotes5
"Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat.",ontonotes5
We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze's assurance last year that Krasnoyarsk didn't violate the ABM treaty.,ontonotes5
"And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited Krasnoyarsk, we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year.",ontonotes5
Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself.,ontonotes5
"The U.S. government's Sverdlovsk complaint, as with Krasnoyarsk, is no mere political posturing.",ontonotes5
"Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate, and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government.",ontonotes5
"But the stated U.S. position is detailed and specific, and the prospect of biological warfare is profoundly chilling.",ontonotes5
"The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or, alternatively, that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident.",ontonotes5
"Northeast's raised bid, which was supported by PS of New Hampshire's official shareholder committee, is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company, the largest utility in New Hampshire.",ontonotes5

"Assuming full operation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant, which is completed but isn't yet operating, equity holders would receive up to$ 500 million in cash, preferred stock and new 10-year Seabrook bonds.",ontonotes5
"In addition, Northeast promised the State of New Hampshire that rate increases would be limited to 5.5% annually for seven years.",ontonotes5
Its previous proposal had conditioned rate limits on Seabrook operations and other contingencies.,ontonotes5
"New England Electric System, Westborough, Mass., has proposed buying the company for$ 2 billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only 4.8% annually for seven years.",ontonotes5

"At dawn on a cool day, hundreds travel to the private market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, hauling pigs, cattle and sacks of feed that the state's official buyers can't induce them to sell.",ontonotes5
"On this morning, he doesn't sell much in Radzymin, either.",ontonotes5
Poland's 2.7 million small private farms cover 76% of its arable land.,ontonotes5
"A few miles past Radzymin, a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into Zalubice, a village of tumbledown farms.",ontonotes5
The dam caused the water level to drop in Zalubice.,ontonotes5
"In Poland, only 4% of all investment goes toward making things farmers want; in the West, it is closer to 20%.",ontonotes5
"A private farmer in Poland is free to buy and sell land, hire help, decide what to grow and how to grow it.",ontonotes5
"By starving the peasant, the Communists have starved Poland.",ontonotes5
Villages like Zalubice exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors.,ontonotes5

The House approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide$ 2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake.,ontonotes5
"The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991, and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week.",ontonotes5
"``We do not come to this House asking for any handout ,'' said the California Democrat.",ontonotes5
The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required.,ontonotes5
"Also, the high price of San Francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average.",ontonotes5

An estimated$ 25.8 million is allocated to continue work in Oman.,ontonotes5
"But all funding is cut for the Philippines, and projects in South Korea are cut to$ 13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request.",ontonotes5
"An estimated$ 38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner, the House chairman.",ontonotes5
"And$ 70.2 million would go to projects in Tennessee represented by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat, Sen. James Sasser.",ontonotes5
"Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference, but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska, Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process.",ontonotes5
"Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd -LRB- D., W.Va. -RRB- even added report language listing$ 49.4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year.",ontonotes5
"No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than Sen. Daniel Inouye -LRB- D., Hawaii -RRB-, who chairs the Senate defense subcommittee.",ontonotes5
"But it gave ground to Mr. Inouye on a number of projects, ranging from a$ 11 million parking garage here, to a land transfer in Hawaii, to a provision to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state.",ontonotes5
The tribe is one of the poorest in the Pacific Northwest.,ontonotes5
"Mobil Corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the U.S., possibly as soon as next month, say individuals familiar with the company's strategy.",ontonotes5
Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver.,ontonotes5
"In yesterday's third-quarter earnings report, the company alluded to a$ 40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations.",ontonotes5
The report says that ``the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations.'',ontonotes5
Individuals familiar with Mobil's strategy say that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output.,ontonotes5

The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale.,ontonotes5
"Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the Burgess Shale, one Charles Doolittle Walcott.",ontonotes5
"Accordingly, the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories.",ontonotes5
It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale.,ontonotes5
"Interest picks up, though, when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution.",ontonotes5
"Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth.",ontonotes5
"Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing, it seems, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia.",ontonotes5
"I, by contrast, can not help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead, beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion.",ontonotes5

"California legislators, searching for ways to pay for the$ 4 billion to$ 6 billion in damages from last week's earthquake, are laying the groundwork for a temporary increase in the state's sales tax.",ontonotes5
The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California's earthquake relief efforts.,ontonotes5
"The state had sought as much as$ 4.1 billion in relief, but yesterday the House approved a more general scaled-back measure calling for$ 2.85 billion in aid, the bulk of which would go to California, with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by Hurricane Hugo.",ontonotes5
"Willie Brown, speaker of California's Assembly, said that Gov. George Deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks.",ontonotes5
California's so-called Gann limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency.,ontonotes5

President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America's national security.,ontonotes5
"There are of course good reasons the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars.",ontonotes5
"As it now stands, the U.S. can bomb Tripoli, but can't ``assassinate'' Colonel Gadhafi.",ontonotes5
"It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley, but can't shoot Abu Nidal.",ontonotes5
Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him.,ontonotes5
"We've heard California's property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 blamed for a lot over the years, but ABC's Ted Koppel came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked Democratic Assemblyman Richard Katz if Prop. 13 had withheld money needed for road maintenance.",ontonotes5

Yet another political scandal is racking Japan.,ontonotes5
"Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling.",ontonotes5
"Pachinko is slightly on the shady side, often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders.",ontonotes5
"Also, about 60% of pachinko parlor owners are Korean, many of whom maintain close ties with North or South Korean residents ' organizations, and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in Japan.",ontonotes5
"But the total of all those pinging balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of 13 trillion yen -LRB- almost$ 92 billion -RRB-, or nearly the size of Japan's vaunted automobile industry.",ontonotes5
"The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents, those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese.",ontonotes5
That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history--their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II--and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society.,ontonotes5
"But LDP members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in innuendo about the JSP's alleged donations, implying that North Korean money would be more suspect than South Korean because North Korea is communist and South Korea is an ally.",ontonotes5

Newport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars.,ontonotes5

The Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately.,ontonotes5

"The U.S. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives, government officials said.",ontonotes5
They said the president conceded the notification requirement didn't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month's Panama coup effort.,ontonotes5
"No notification was ever considered, officials said, apparently because the U.S. didn't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega, but merely sought to imprison him.",ontonotes5
"A statement issued by the office of the committee chairman, Sen. David Boren -LRB- D., Okla. -RRB-, charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama.",ontonotes5
"Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine, the panel's vice chairman, said of the disclosure that ``a text torn out of context is a pretext, and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion.''",ontonotes5
"Instead, both congressional and administration officials agreed, it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October.",ontonotes5
"The guideline wasn't a law, but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations.",ontonotes5
One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. ``gets wind'' of somebody else's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator's life.,ontonotes5
But a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S..,ontonotes5
"Although the notification guideline wasn't carried out in this month's coup attempt, some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama.",ontonotes5
One senior administration official called the guideline ``outrageous'' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble.,ontonotes5
"The issue came to a head last year, officials recalled, partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts.",ontonotes5
"Last week, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups.",ontonotes5
"However, last week Mr. Webster's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs hadn't hampered the spy agency's role in the coup attempt in Panama.",ontonotes5

"Jindo Furs, a large South Korean maker, says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year.",ontonotes5

Mr. Utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about ``the status of their participation'' in one previous U.S. leveraged buy-out.,ontonotes5
The ministry inquired about that deal--which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify--because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was ``being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress'' and it was ``necessary for us to grasp the situation.'',ontonotes5

"When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions last July, the justices almost certainly didn't have drunk driving, trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds.",ontonotes5
"In the Missouri case, unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state's 1986 abortion law.",ontonotes5
"Last year, a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional, citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states can't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins.",ontonotes5
"Already, local Missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to Reproductive Health Services, an abortion clinic in St. Louis.",ontonotes5
"Under a 1981 Missouri law, persons accused of some crimes, including trespassing, may offer a defense that their actions were justified ``as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury.''",ontonotes5

The only reason that Somalia remains in obscurity is numbers: a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas.,ontonotes5
"Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of Marxist Ethiopia because of the behavior of President Barre's troops.",ontonotes5
"In the port of Berbera, for example, hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded up in May 1988, imprisoned, and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever.",ontonotes5

"Desperate, he has called in the Libyans to help fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north, which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of Mogadishu.",ontonotes5
"The U.S.'s interest in Somalia consists of a single runway at the port of Berbera, which U.S. military aircraft have the right to use for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.",ontonotes5

"Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa, threatening the town of Dese, which would cut off Mr. Mengistu's capital from the port of Assab, through which all fuel and other supplies reach Addis Ababa.",ontonotes5
"As a result, Mr. Mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from Eritrea just to hold the town, thereby risking the loss of even more territory in Eritrea only to keep the Tigreans at bay.",ontonotes5
Mr. Mengistu is in an increasingly weak position: Half his army is tied down defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans.,ontonotes5
"The weaker he gets, the more he turns toward the U.S. for help.",ontonotes5
What this all means in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre's regime in Somalia is.,ontonotes5
"The U.S., therefore, has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa.",ontonotes5

"What's more, the U.S. has suspended$ 2.5 million in military aid and$ 1 million in economic aid.",ontonotes5
"Because the U.S. is still perceived to be tied to Mr. Barre, when he goes the runway could go too.",ontonotes5
"The U.S. should take care, however, that its own position in the country does not go down with him.",ontonotes5
Nobody is sure what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be.,ontonotes5
"While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia, it should continue to back former President Carter's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia, while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan.",ontonotes5
"Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated, secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa.",ontonotes5
But the U.S. has one great advantage: The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade--famine and all.,ontonotes5
"It's not just in Eastern Europe where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side, but on the horn of Africa as well.",ontonotes5

"And the United Arab Emirates, a chronic quota cheater, refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways.",ontonotes5

"Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin, also has surfaced as a possible obstacle, some OPEC sources said.",ontonotes5

"There also is concern that once Hong Kong reverts to China's sovereignty in 1997, Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China's often-disparaged flag carrier, Civil Aviation Administration of China, or CAAC.",ontonotes5
"Sarah Hall, an analyst at James Capel -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd., says there isn't much Cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel, Hong Kong's tight labor market, or the strengthening of the local currency, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.",ontonotes5
"In 1988, it earned$ 2.82 billion Hong Kong -LRB- US$ 361.5 million -RRB- on revenue of HK$ 11.79 billion.",ontonotes5
"The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights, while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America.",ontonotes5
Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong.,ontonotes5
"Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay's labor costs by 20% a year for low-level staff, while experienced, skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain.",ontonotes5
"Some jobs already have been moved to Australia, and there are plans to place others in Canada.",ontonotes5
"Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits, rather than just a stopover.",ontonotes5
"Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights, Cathay's other routes have retained high load factors.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Eddington regards promoting Hong Kong as an important part of attracting visitors from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged.",ontonotes5
"There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government's plans to build a new airport, with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal.",ontonotes5
"But he emphasizes that Cathay hasn't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa, the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade.",ontonotes5
"In a pattern it aims to copy in several key U.S. destinations, Cathay recently announced plans to serve San Francisco by flying into American Airlines ' Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on the U.S. carrier.",ontonotes5
"``We'll never have a big operation in the U.S., and they'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific ,'' Mr. Eddington says.",ontonotes5
"``But this way, American will coordinate good extensions to Boston, New York, Chicago and Dallas.",ontonotes5
"We'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok, Singapore and Manila.''",ontonotes5
"Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into China to 14, and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into Vietnam.",ontonotes5
"Further expansion into southern Europe is also possible, says Mr. Bell, the spokesman.",ontonotes5
"While a large number of Hong Kong companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of 1997, such a move isn't an option for Cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
And Mr. Eddington emphatically rules out a move to London: ``Our lifeblood is Hong Kong traffic rights.'',ontonotes5
He says the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong's return to China.,ontonotes5
"A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong's airlines, which include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines, will continue to be negotiated by Hong Kong's government.",ontonotes5

"A shopping center of similar size in an affluent Los Angeles suburb would, per year, be expected to have eight burglaries, 70 thefts of or from autos, and four robberies.",ontonotes5
The Watts mall has annual sales of more than$ 350 per leasable square foot; the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be$ 200.,ontonotes5
Three other Haagen shopping centers in the Watts area are doing almost as well.,ontonotes5
Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop.,ontonotes5
"It continues through the life of the center; the Vermont-Slauson Center has created 500 permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only$ 2,500 per job.",ontonotes5
Profits are also plowed back into the community; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60% of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community--now running into the hundreds of units--as well as commercial and industrial development projects.,ontonotes5
"Bradford Crowe, director of the mayor's City Economic Development Office, says: ``There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood.",ontonotes5

"The Red and White Fleet, which operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County, and tourist tours of the bay, is offering East Bay commuters a chance to ride the waves for the price of$ 10 round-trip.",ontonotes5
That tariff is too stiff for some Financial District wage earners.,ontonotes5

One Washington couple recently sold their liquor store after 34 years in business that included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises.,ontonotes5
"This may help explain why small businesses create 65% of all jobs nationally, but only 22% of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York.",ontonotes5

China's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade.,ontonotes5
"The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86, when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange.",ontonotes5

"``The freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading ,'' says Raymond Wong, China manager for Mannesmann AG, a West German machinery-trading company.",ontonotes5
"The picture for China's exports is just as bleak, mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze.",ontonotes5
"The threat to China's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves, excluding gold holdings.",ontonotes5
The trend has prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports.,ontonotes5
"In recent weeks, China's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities.",ontonotes5
Beijing's periodic clampdowns on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping China export.,ontonotes5

"``It has difficulties paying its foreign debts ,'' says a Hong Kong executive who is familiar with Sitco's business.",ontonotes5
Foreign traders also say many of China's big infrastructural projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit.,ontonotes5
"Even when new lending resumes, foreign exchange would still be tight because Beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing, which has grown between 30% and 40% in the past few years.",ontonotes5
And foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because China is nearing a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years.,ontonotes5
"Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel, chemical fertilizers and plastics.",ontonotes5
"To stem speculation, Beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year.",ontonotes5
But Beijing can't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without hampering the country's export business.,ontonotes5

"In his office overlooking the runway of Shannon Airport, Mr. Ovcharenko enthusiastically throws out what he calls ``just ideas'':",ontonotes5
"First, he suggests, GPA Group Ltd., the international aircraft leasing company based in Ireland, could lease some of its Boeing jetliners to the Soviet airline.",ontonotes5
"Then Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, could teach Aeroflot pilots to fly the Boeings, and the fleet could be based here at Shannon Airport.",ontonotes5
"Aer Rianta, the Irish airport authority, could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union.",ontonotes5
And then there is his notion of an Irish-Soviet charter airline to ferry Armenians to Los Angeles via Shannon.,ontonotes5
The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport.,ontonotes5
"Unlikely as it may seem, tiny, politically neutral Ireland has penetrated the mighty Soviet airline bureaucracy.",ontonotes5
"Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year, and Shannon Airport, the airline's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union, saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through.",ontonotes5
The airport's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union.,ontonotes5

"Thanks to a new air-traffic agreement and the ability of Irish travel agents to issue Aeroflot tickets, tourists here are taking advantage of Aeroflot's reasonable prices to board flights in Shannon for holidays in Havana, Kingston and Mexico City.",ontonotes5
The round-trip fare to Havana is 410 Irish punts -LRB-$ 578 -RRB-.,ontonotes5
Jamaica costs 504 punts.,ontonotes5
"When it opened in 1939, Shannon was the first landfall in Europe for thirsty airplanes flying from North America.",ontonotes5
"Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets, but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that can't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop.",ontonotes5
"As a result, Ireland didn't spurn the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan in 1983, though it suspended direct Moscow-Shannon flights for two months.",ontonotes5
"In fact, Aer Lingus started ferrying Russians from Shannon to New York when Washington stripped Aeroflot of its U.S. landing rights.",ontonotes5

"But we still hear him moaning at night because the Navy has a few ships left, and to satisfy him the Navy's sea lift forces were given to a new Air Force bureaucracy in Illinois, its space operations to another command in Colorado, the frogmen to a new Army bureaucracy in Fort Bragg, and the Navy's Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf forces to an Army bureaucracy in Florida.",ontonotes5
Which brings up the worst and meanest ghost of all--the ghost of the shah of Iran.,ontonotes5
Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran.,ontonotes5
So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in Tampa called the Rapid Deployment Force.,ontonotes5
"He bought$ 4 billion in prepositioning ships and$ 7 billion in ammo and equipment to fill them, and parked them at a new$ 6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean.",ontonotes5
He dedicated all these new forces to the Persian Gulf.,ontonotes5
Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the RDF in Tampa and renamed it Central Command.,ontonotes5
He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean.,ontonotes5
"But the shah still kept leaping out at Cap, so Cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and$ 7 billion of loading barges, ramps, etc., in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine brigades could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the Zagros mountains.",ontonotes5
"Then suddenly Ike's ghost came to visit and said, ``What the hell are you doing planning for a land war in Asia 12,000 miles away?",ontonotes5

"Still, Berbera was the best we could get, so we stay in bed with President Barrah.",ontonotes5
"But wouldn't you know, now that we are spending jillions of dollars, and have built those new divisions and new air wings, and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the Russians in Iran, the Russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject.",ontonotes5
"Predictably, some Navy guys said: ``Do we still need to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra land-based aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing admiral in Tampa?",ontonotes5

"For just as the Arabs were in the 1960s, the farmers of Sidhpur are on the brink of global power and fame.",ontonotes5
"That is because Sidhpur has a near-monopoly on the world's supply of flea seed, also known as flea wort or, in Western parlance, psyllium: a tiny, tasteless, obscure seed that, according to early research, may reduce cholesterol levels in the blood.",ontonotes5

Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so.,ontonotes5

One of the most remarkable features of the forced marches of the ethnic Turks out of Bulgaria over the past five months has been the lack of international attention.,ontonotes5
"Today's Turks in Bulgaria, in other words, deserve what is coming to them four centuries later.",ontonotes5
"On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24, 1990, as the ``National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923 ,'' suffered at the hands of the warring Ottoman Empire.",ontonotes5
"It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey, a country that has been one of America's strongest allies in NATO.",ontonotes5
The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community.,ontonotes5
"Turkey has been fighting its past for years, and thus far has been only partially successful.",ontonotes5
Such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward Turkey that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis.,ontonotes5
"Mr. Dole's odd effort notwithstanding, most of Turkey's political problems lie with the Europeans.",ontonotes5
Part of the problem some Europeans have with Turkey seems to stem from its location--Turkey isn't really part of Europe.,ontonotes5
"Another anti-Turkish hook is the Islamic faith of the majority of the Turkish people: Turkey, we are told, is not a Christian nation; its people simply won't fit in with the Western European Judeo-Christian tradition.",ontonotes5
It's when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore.,ontonotes5
No one has to accept the sins of the Ottoman Empire to reject that argument.,ontonotes5
Turkey in any event is long past it.,ontonotes5
"Kurds, suffering what many people consider to be a current extermination campaign at the hands of Syria, Iran and Iraq have inundated eastern Turkey.",ontonotes5

"East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker, one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world, in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens.",ontonotes5
"But while it was a move that stunned the East bloc, it hardly ushers in an era of reform--at least anytime soon.",ontonotes5
"For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker, who had led East Germany for 18 years and before that headed its security apparatus, with a man cut of the same cloth: Egon Krenz, the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege.",ontonotes5
"East Germany, it is clear, is no Poland, where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union.",ontonotes5
"Nor is it a Hungary, where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy.",ontonotes5
"Still, any change in East Germany has enormous implications, for both East and West.",ontonotes5
"It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification--a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow, Washington and Western Europe.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Krenz, 52, was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Honecker's ignoble fall culminates nearly two decades of iron-handed leadership during which Mr. Honecker, now 77 years old, built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc.",ontonotes5
Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers ' uprising in 1953.,ontonotes5
"In Washington, the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change.",ontonotes5
But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer.,ontonotes5
"One top U.S. expert on East Germany added: ``There is no clear-cut champion of reform, that we know of, in the East German leadership.''",ontonotes5
"Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland, he was eight years old when World War II ended.",ontonotes5
"Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany's division.",ontonotes5
"Notably, one of Mr. Krenz's few official visits overseas came a few months ago, when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing.",ontonotes5
He later defended the Chinese government's response during a separate visit to West Germany.,ontonotes5
"His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor, Mr. Honecker.",ontonotes5
"According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin, it was Mr. Krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig.",ontonotes5
"``He doesn't want to have the image of the gun man ,'' says Fred Oldenburg, an expert at the Bonn-sponsored Institute of East European and International Studies in Cologne.",ontonotes5
"Chancellor Kohl, meanwhile, has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects.",ontonotes5
"Reports in the West German press, citing sources in East Germany, suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader.",ontonotes5
"``This is a dynamic process and we're experiencing the first step ,'' the Bonn official adds.",ontonotes5
The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow.,ontonotes5
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in East Germany's rigid stance.,ontonotes5
"Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker, Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, were passed over.",ontonotes5
If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify.,ontonotes5
"In Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev sent Mr. Krenz a congratulatory telegram that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change.",ontonotes5
"According to the Soviet news agency Tass, ``Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of -LCB- East -RCB- Germany, being sensitive to the demands of the time ,... will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR -LCB- German Democratic Republic -RCB- encountered.''",ontonotes5
"From the perspective of East Germany's old guard, reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country's reason for being.",ontonotes5
"Unlike the other nations of the bloc, East Germany is a creature of the Cold War.",ontonotes5
"Erasing the differences still dividing Europe, and the vast international reordering that implies, won't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary.",ontonotes5
But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map.,ontonotes5
"``I'm sure they'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR's future as a separately identifiable state ,'' says Michael Simmons, a British journalist whose book on East Germany, entitled ``The Unloved Country ,'' was published this month.",ontonotes5
"Up to now, that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country's international legitimacy, followed by Mr. Honecker's campaign to build the East bloc's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise.",ontonotes5
"Early in 1987, Mr. Honecker and his team stopped paying thin compliments to Mr. Gorbachev and joined with Romania in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems.",ontonotes5
"With this year's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union, and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary, the East German leadership grew still more defensive.",ontonotes5
"Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck, not to merge with the West.",ontonotes5
"Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs, Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow.",ontonotes5
He was a ``socialist warrior'' who felt rankled by West Germany's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state.,ontonotes5
"Finally, during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago, he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought.",ontonotes5

"But here in Morgenzon, a sleepy town amid the corn fields of the eastern Transvaal, the Orange Workers are holding the pillars steady.",ontonotes5
"The Orange Workers--who take their name from William of Orange of the Netherlands, a hero of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners--believe that the solution to South Africa's racial problems isn't the abolition of apartheid, it's the perfection of apartheid--complete and total separation of the races.",ontonotes5
This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa.,ontonotes5
"But their ideal of an Afrikaner homeland, an all-white reserve to be carved out of present-day South Africa, is a mainstream desire of the right-wing, which embraces about one-third of the country's five million whites.",ontonotes5

"On Main Street, Alida Verwoerd and her daughters look after the clothes and fabric shop, then hurry home to fix lunch for the rest of the family.",ontonotes5

"``We agree with world opinion that the status quo in South Africa is morally wrong ,'' says Pieter Bruwer, the Orange Workers ' chief scribe and pamphleteer.",ontonotes5
Morgenzon has long been a special domain of Afrikanerdom.,ontonotes5
"According to Mr. Verwoerd, the early Afrikaner pioneers were the first people to settle in the eastern Transvaal, even before the blacks.",ontonotes5
"Then, when Morgenzon was incorporated in 1908, the farmer who owned the land stipulated that only whites could reside in town; blacks could work there, but they had to leave at night.",ontonotes5
"Today, Morgenzon is a town of 800 whites and two paved roads.",ontonotes5
"It was an ideal place for the Orange Workers to start their new nation, unencumbered by the demographics that have undermined apartheid elsewhere in South Africa.",ontonotes5
"Over at the Shell station, owner Rudi van Dyk, who doubles as Morgenzon's mayor, worries that the Orange Workers have made his town the laughingstock of the nation.",ontonotes5
"The son believes that when the Afrikaners finally realize there is no turning back the integration of South African society and politics, Morgenzon will boom.",ontonotes5

A frozen mountaintop in Tibet may offer an important clue about whether the Earth is warming perilously.,ontonotes5

"The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times, largely because of pollutants in the air, and will warm far more in the century ahead.",ontonotes5
"A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth's polar ice caps, raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas.",ontonotes5
"Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap, a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level, show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age, Mr. Thompson said.",ontonotes5
"Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans, which moderate temperature changes.",ontonotes5
"According to greenhouse theories, increased carbon dioxide emissions, largely caused by burning of fossil fuels, will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space.",ontonotes5
"Instead, the Dunde ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s, decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s, then higher temperatures again through last year.",ontonotes5

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his U.S. antagonists have failed to do: revive a constituency for the Contra rebels.,ontonotes5
"Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D., Maine -RRB- said yesterday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' that Mr. Ortega's threat was ``a very unwise move, particularly the timing of it.''",ontonotes5

Mr. Bush returned to Washington Saturday night.,ontonotes5
"Saturday, he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras.",ontonotes5
He asked that the remaining U.S. humanitarian aid be diverted to disarming and demobilizing the rebels.,ontonotes5
"Not only did Mr. Ortega's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a showcase for the region, it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections.",ontonotes5
Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates.,ontonotes5
And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the$ 49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March.,ontonotes5
"The humanitarian assistance, which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels amassed along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras, replaced the military aid cut off by Congress in February 1988.",ontonotes5
"Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R., Kan. -RRB- said yesterday on ``Meet the Press'': ``I would hope after his -LCB- Mr. Ortega's -RCB- act yesterday or the day before, we 'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid.''",ontonotes5
Mr. Ortega's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves.,ontonotes5
"Secretary of State James Baker, who accompanied President Bush to Costa Rica, told reporters Friday: ``I have no reason to deny reports that some Contras ambushed some Sandinista soldiers.''",ontonotes5
He added that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire.,ontonotes5
"In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections.",ontonotes5

"Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R., a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul, the refugees sit in their camps, and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever.",ontonotes5
But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily.,ontonotes5
Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary--and did.,ontonotes5
The U.S. said it would fully support the resistance--and didn't.,ontonotes5
"With the February 1987 U.N. accords ``relating to Afghanistan ,'' the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control.",ontonotes5
The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind--including the return of Soviet ground forces--while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid.,ontonotes5
"The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did.",ontonotes5
"In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further.",ontonotes5
Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than$ 1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime.,ontonotes5
"Since the troop withdrawal, Moscow has poured in an additional$ 200 to$ 300 million worth per month--nearly$ 2 billion since February, equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years.",ontonotes5
"By early May, Moscow had delivered, for example, 1,000 trucks, about 100 tanks, artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles.",ontonotes5
"By September, a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles, 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar.",ontonotes5
"In the last few weeks, Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles, the bomber version of the An-12, MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft, MiG-29s, which can outfly Pakistan's U.S.-built F16s, and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers, which can outfly the MiG-29s.",ontonotes5
Moscow claims this is all needed to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance.,ontonotes5
"But this is not the entire Afghan army, and it is no longer Kabul's only military force.",ontonotes5
"Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned.",ontonotes5

"Since 1981, Indian military advisers have been assisting the Kabul regime.",ontonotes5

"Rep. Bill McCollum -LRB- R., Fla. -RRB- reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards, ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics.",ontonotes5
"In autumn last year, for example, the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates.",ontonotes5
"The deal fell through, and Kandahar remains a major regime base.",ontonotes5
"Instead, they were pressured by Pakistan's ISI, the channel for their support, into attacking Jalalabad.",ontonotes5
"The wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the Kabul regime, but that it continues to exist and fight at all.",ontonotes5
"Indeed, U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year.",ontonotes5
Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful.,ontonotes5
"For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent, based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf.",ontonotes5
A cutoff of U.S. military aid would merely abandon them to die in vain.,ontonotes5

"The rebel officer's slow and painful death, at the headquarters of Panama's Battalion-2000 squad, was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega, says a U.S. official with access to intelligence reports.",ontonotes5
"Leaping into rages, sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust, Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup, according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City.",ontonotes5
"In the two weeks since the rebellion, which the U.S. hesitantly backed, Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal-and efficient-in maintaining power.",ontonotes5
"Yet, while the failed coup is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment, it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades.",ontonotes5
"America's war on the dictator over the past two years, following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988, is the legacy of that relationship.",ontonotes5
"Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega, it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama's long history of conspirators and pirates.",ontonotes5
"In 1960, for example, when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute, according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period.",ontonotes5
"But U.S. intelligence, rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy, merely filed the report away.",ontonotes5
Mr. Noriega's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests.,ontonotes5
"From that point on, the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian's misadventures.",ontonotes5
"The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators, but none quite so resourceful.",ontonotes5
"The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega isn't as smooth as the shah of Iran, as well-born as Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti's Baby Doc Duvalier.",ontonotes5
"And out of necessity: The U.S. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power, but a single error on his part could cost him his life.",ontonotes5
"``The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along ,'' says Ambler Moss, a former Ambassador to Panama.",ontonotes5
"In keeping with America's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega, recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama's dire economic situation, says Mr. Moss, but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression, and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement.",ontonotes5
"``If the U.S. had sat back and done nothing, he might not have made it through 1988 ,'' Mr. Moss contends.",ontonotes5
"One Colombian drug boss, upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile, sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name.",ontonotes5
"The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959, when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima, according to former U.S. intelligence officials.",ontonotes5
"The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega's half-brother, a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado.",ontonotes5
"Born the illegitimate son of his father's maid, he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City.",ontonotes5
"``He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism, where officers were the elite with special privileges ,'' recalls Darien Ayala, a fellow student in Peru and a lifelong friend.",ontonotes5
"His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison, Major Omar Torrijos, gave him an intriguing assignment: Mr. Noriega would organize the province's first intelligence service.",ontonotes5
"The spy network would serve two clients: the Panamanian government, by monitoring political opponents in the region, and the U.S., by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co.'s banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles.",ontonotes5
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama's national income.,ontonotes5
"A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964--as chief of the transit police in David City, capital of the Chiriqui Province--was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy.",ontonotes5
"So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles, which was ruled by United Fruit Co.",ontonotes5
"``It was like a play on Broadway ,'' recalls Mr. Martinez.",ontonotes5
"During his years in Chiriqui, however, Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious.",ontonotes5
"Rodrigo Miranda, a local lawyer and human-rights monitor, recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David, where he had his offices.",ontonotes5
"But through this period, so far as the U.S. military was concerned, Mr. Noriega was a model recruit.",ontonotes5
"He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967, according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret.",ontonotes5
"He flew to Fort Bragg, N.C., in September of that year for a course in psychological operations, returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called ``military intelligence for officers.''",ontonotes5
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier.,ontonotes5
"He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets.",ontonotes5
"When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans.",ontonotes5
"``Early on in the State Department, we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel, in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States ,'' recalls Francis J. McNeil, who, as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, first ran across reports about Mr. Noriega in 1977.",ontonotes5
"But he did fly to Panama to scold dictator Torrijos on the drug ties of Panamanian officials, including Mr. Noriega.",ontonotes5
Mr. Ingersoll later recalled that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S..,ontonotes5
"Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976, when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army's 470th Military Intelligence Group.",ontonotes5
"For the first time, the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll--and the deliberations were intense, Mr. Turner says.",ontonotes5
Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration.,ontonotes5
The U.S. soon found new cause for concern: gun-running.,ontonotes5
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza.,ontonotes5
"At the time, though, in 1979, the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy.",ontonotes5
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon.,ontonotes5
"Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to fly through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.",ontonotes5
"On Monday, U.S. officials received a routine, unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama.",ontonotes5
"``Due to health reasons, Lt. Col. Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington ,'' it read.",ontonotes5
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback.,ontonotes5
"In January 1980, Jerome Sanford, as assistant U.S. attorney, was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Miami.",ontonotes5
"Panamanian dictator Torrijos, he was told, had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington.",ontonotes5
"After prodding from Mr. Sanford, U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed.",ontonotes5
"``Unfortunately ,'' Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter, ``those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control.''",ontonotes5
"In August 1983, Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama, having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos.",ontonotes5
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll.,ontonotes5
"Although working for U.S. intelligence, Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively.",ontonotes5
"He allegedly entered into Panama's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses, according to Floyd Carlton, a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges.",ontonotes5
"But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House wouldn't act against him, recalls his close ally Jose Blandon, because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.",ontonotes5
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama.,ontonotes5
Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.,ontonotes5
"And on at least one occasion, in the spring of 1985, he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua.",ontonotes5
"Although, his help for the Contra cause was limited, it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration, says Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",ontonotes5
"``Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin ,'' he says.",ontonotes5
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington--by compromising U.S. officials.,ontonotes5
"Curtin Windsor, then the ambassador to Costa Rica, recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and ``quiet, serious conversation'' on the Aswara Peninsula.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, of the invitation.",ontonotes5
"As Mr. Noriega's political troubles grew, so did his offers of assistance to the Contras, an apparent attempt to curry more favor in Washington.",ontonotes5
"But just one month later, he also contributed$ 100,000 to a Contra leader, according to documents released for Oliver North's criminal trial in Washington, D.C.",ontonotes5
"He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta, a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S., after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder.",ontonotes5
"And, all the while, Panama's debt problems continued to grow.",ontonotes5
"In late 1986, he made an offer he thought the U.S. couldn't refuse.",ontonotes5
"``North ,'' the document went on, referring to Oliver North, ``has told Noriega's representative that U.S. law forbade such actions.",ontonotes5
"The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things, just as Noriega had helped -LCB- the U.S.. -RCB- the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal.''",ontonotes5
Lawyers in Miami--this time working virtually without impediment--prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February 1988.,ontonotes5
"During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation, Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans, whom he had helped for so many years, could turn against him.",ontonotes5
"Now, neither side--the U.S. nor Mr. Noriega--has an easy out.",ontonotes5
"Tuesday's rout of a GOP congressional hopeful in a Mississippi district that hasn't backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Adlai Stevenson is another reminder that, at least at the federal level, political ``ticket splitting'' has been on the rise over the past half century.",ontonotes5
"Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South.",ontonotes5
"To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.",ontonotes5
"Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices--where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.",ontonotes5
Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage.,ontonotes5
"``Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies ,'' said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md.",ontonotes5
"It ``may well be'' that theft of business data is ``as serious a strategic threat to national security'' as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs.",ontonotes5
"Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year, most aren't yet taking precautions, the experts said.",ontonotes5

"BNL, which is controlled by the Italian Treasury, was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than$ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq.",ontonotes5

Guangzhou Starts Puffing Itself up -LRB- reposted from Moonlight blog -RRB-,ontonotes5
"I went to sina.com today and suddenly saw a""strange""article from China Business News:""Guangzhou to Become First Mainland City with a GDP per Capita of over 10,000 US Dollars""<http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2007-01-04/051211947888.shtml>.",ontonotes5
"It says that the mayor of Guangzhou has said that calculated by the number of people registered as residents, the GDP per capita of Guangzhou this year will exceed 10,000 US dollars.",ontonotes5
"The reason I thought it was strange was because according to some data that I already knew about <http://www.williamlong.info/archives/459.html>, Guangzhou's GDP per capita should only reach the target of 10,000 US dollars in 2010.",ontonotes5
Shenzhen and other cities all calculate GDP per capita using the permanent resident population in the calculation.,ontonotes5
"If Guangzhou calculates the GDP per capita using the permanent resident population, it's obviously puffing itself up.",ontonotes5
People from Guangdong are usually very low-key about wealth.,ontonotes5
They 'd never compare these vanities with Beijing or Shanghai.,ontonotes5
"In addition, everyone is very clear about the situations in Guangzhou and Shenzhen.",ontonotes5
For many years Guangzhou has been just a little behind Shenzhen in its economic indices and all aspects.,ontonotes5
"Its GDP will soon be exceeded by Shenzhen's, yet its population has always been higher than Shenzhen's.",ontonotes5
"Shenzhen's GDP per capita is calculated using the number of permanent residents, and it is predicted that it won't top 10,000 US dollars until about 2008.",ontonotes5
How could Guangzhou's leaders make this kind of wild assertion?,ontonotes5
This kind of showing off has never been the style of people from Guangdong.,ontonotes5
Various signs show that the new team of leaders in Guangzhou may have been transferred from another region.,ontonotes5
"If this really is the case, then Guangzhou's prospects for economic development may be indeed not good.",ontonotes5
Fewer empty words and more real action has always been the straightforward style of people from Guangdong.,ontonotes5
I hope the new team of leaders in Guangzhou will carefully learn from the experiences and lessons of the last few administrations and not to rival with places like Beijing and Shanghai in exaggeration.,ontonotes5
Otherwise Guangzhou's development will really be a cause for worry.,ontonotes5

"In a nutshell, the rebalancing plan the world so urgently needs is nothing more than a thorough reshaping of the global savings mix-that is, an improvement in the U.S. savings rate, which has been stagnant for a long time, and a lessening of excessive savings in other countries -LRB- especially in Asia and the Middle East -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"As for the United States, this will augur low exchange rates for the U.S. dollar, and an expansion of effective interest rates on U.S.-dollar capital.",ontonotes5
"Although as the end of the year approached the U.S. dollar dropped somewhat, and effective interest rates continued to climb, this movement was still very far from the radical adjustments predicted by the framework of the rebalancing theory.",ontonotes5
I choose the former; I believe the reason lies in the prolongation of the period of excess current capital worldwide and the policy of central banks in Asia and the Middle East of buying up U.S. dollars.,ontonotes5
"Whereas the advance of globalization will spur sources of new demand from China, India and other commodity-intensive economic systems, asymmetry between supply and increasingly fierce demand causes exponents of supercycles to issue the highest commodity price forecasts in history.",ontonotes5

"Influenced by the slowing of exports to the United States, combined with the deliberate cool-down in the overheated investment sector, China's growth will slow next year.",ontonotes5
"We can undoubtedly draw some important lessons and tips from last year's economy, but there is another important thing here; I still believe that the two main engines driving global growth will slow down under the influence of the burst real estate bubble in the United States and the cool-down in investments in China.",ontonotes5

China is Capable of withstanding the Impacts Brought to China by US Economic Recession.,ontonotes5
"Following the recession in 2001, the US economy has entered into""soft-landing""adjustment after five years of continuous expansion.",ontonotes5
"Some expect that in 2007 the US economic growth rate will drop to 1.9-2.5 percent, the interest rate will drop to 4 percent, and the US dollar will continue to depreciate.",ontonotes5
"Once the US economy is in recession, will impacts will it bring to China?",ontonotes5
And what measures will China take in response?,ontonotes5
Pressure brought to China by the US economic recession.,ontonotes5
The United States is the powerhouse of the world economy and the largest international market.,ontonotes5
The USD$ 800-billion annual trade deficit indicates global exports are heavily dependent on the US.,ontonotes5
"The US is our No. 2 trade partner, No. 1 export market, No. 6 import source, and No. 3 technology import source.",ontonotes5
"China's total export value was USD$ 875 billion from January to November 2006, of which 21% was export to the US.",ontonotes5
"Plus the portion re-exported from Hong Kong, export to the US accounted for over 35 percent of the total Chinese export value.",ontonotes5
"Export of Chinese shipping, low-end electronics, furniture, textiles and artware could all be affected should the US experience economic recession.",ontonotes5
"In addition, other developing countries in Asia are major suppliers in the supply chain centered around China, and the supply chain is driven by the US demand.",ontonotes5
"As a result, slowdown of the US economy represents a huge pressure for the entire Asia.",ontonotes5
Some expect that China's export growth rate will decrease from 23 percent to 15 percent in 2007.,ontonotes5
China is fully capable of withstanding the impacts.,ontonotes5
"Regardless of the accuracy of various comments, China must be prepared to cope with the US economic recession.",ontonotes5
"Although some predictions are a little sensational, the author believes the US economic recession this time will not be very severe, with less impacts on China than other countries.",ontonotes5
"From the current situation, strong domestic investment within China has fully compensated the impact of the decrease in net export.",ontonotes5
It would be exaggerating to say China is 70 percent dependent on foreign trade.,ontonotes5
"The statistics has underestimated China's Gross National Product -LRB- GNP -RRB-, especially that of the tertiary sector.",ontonotes5
Converting to US dollar at the exchange rate has also underestimated China's Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB-.,ontonotes5
"Therefore, there is no need to magnify China's dependence on export to the US.",ontonotes5
"Export-oriented economic growth of China should be cooled down, while the role of domestic demand and import should be promoted.",ontonotes5
"If factors such as the rapid development of the tertiary sector and the appreciation of RMB are taken into consideration, China's dependence on foreign trade can be controlled at around 50 percent in the long run.",ontonotes5
"Over the last 20 years, the world has experienced many economic crashes, affecting countries or regions such as Russia, Arab, Latin America and East Asia.",ontonotes5
The US also suffered stock market crash in 2001.,ontonotes5
China is the only one to realize economic emergence for the largest population in the history.,ontonotes5
"Whenever there is an international economic recession, China would actively expand domestic demand to create market for different countries.",ontonotes5
"In fact, China has long been a responsible big nation, playing a stabilizing role to the international society.",ontonotes5
"Long-term high-speed growth in China has led to significant wealth growth, as well as different kinds of disequilibriums, such as: too much savings and investments and insufficient consumptions; heavy investment in infrastructure and manufacturing, and insufficient investment in national defense, science and technology, education, health, environment and national reserves; wider income gap, regional gap and gap between urban and rural areas; the economy has become dependent on the US market to some extent due to long-term export orientation and trade surplus to the United States; and environmental resource outflow by way of exporting, so on and so forth.",ontonotes5
This is also why China is not afraid of a global economic crisis and capable of digesting it.,ontonotes5
"However, after 2020, China will be facing the puzzle of population aging, which is sure to witness an economic slowdown.",ontonotes5
Various disequilibriums in the rapid growth of China must be adjusted.,ontonotes5
Whether the impacts brought to China by the US economic recession can be resisted and the impacts on the world economy can be alleviated hinge on whether or not China can truly expand its domestic demand.,ontonotes5
"The next few years may see the Chinese economy cooling down, a continuous modest rise in RMB, a slowdown in the speed and volume of export growth, a possible decrease in trade surplus, and speculative capital and the real estate bubble in control, which are adjustments from disequilibriums to equilibriums in the economic relations between China and the United States and between China and the world, as well as in the social relations within China.",ontonotes5

The most obvious part of China's being a big country was its population advantage.,ontonotes5
"In fact Japan's total population after it had taken over Taiwan, the Northeast, and Korea was not so very much smaller than China's, with about 200 million people, at best a 2:1 ratio.",ontonotes5
"The important thing is that Japan had a complete reserve system, with more than four million reserves who had received basic military training.",ontonotes5
"China had basically no reserve military personnel, and the""national army""relied primarily on seizing able-bodied men to fill its ranks.",ontonotes5
What was even more disheartening was China's disintegration:,ontonotes5

China's perseverance was just the right thing to strike at Japan's weak spot; countries like Japan have trouble sustaining a high-intensity war.,ontonotes5
"The First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and 9/18 all ended in a short time, and there were no destructive effects on Japan's economic structure.",ontonotes5
"On the other hand, each time they fought, they acquired a large amount of booty, which greatly increased Japan's strength.",ontonotes5
"Despite America's strength and wealth, it was even unable to bear the cost of the Vietnam War.",ontonotes5
"Four years of fierce fighting in China had in fact left Japan exhausted; military spending was exploding, inflation at home was soaring, supplies were stretched thin, gold and foreign currency reserves were depleted, and the domestic economy was on the verge of collapse, and this enabled America to throttle the Japanese by the neck, meaning that they forced the Japanese to take a highly risky military gamble.",ontonotes5

"The visit is the second for Peres to Qatar, which he visited before in 1996 in his capacity as Prime Minister of Israel, according to the Chairman of the Israeli Commercial Delegation, Roi Rosenblit's, statement in Doha.",ontonotes5

"By the way, the First Lady of Qatar, we knew........",ontonotes5

A lot of people from three Gulf countries... use this name..!,ontonotes5
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres quoted the Prince of Qatar as saying the Islamic Resistance Movement -LRB- Hamas -RRB- would make peace if Israel would abandon the lands it occupied in the 1967 war.,ontonotes5
"Peres said he also discussed Iran's nuclear ambitions with Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, Prince of Qatar, during a rare visit to the American-allied Gulf country, his first in a decade.",ontonotes5
""" In his judgment, if Israel would go back to the borders of 1967, Hamas would make peace with Israel,""Peres told reporters after the meeting.",ontonotes5
"Israel""should, pay so much attention to their declarations, as they have to please another audience,""he reported Sheikh Hamad as saying in the meeting, which lasted for one hour, and which he described as""frank and amiable. """,ontonotes5
Peres said the talks also addressed Iran's nuclear program.,ontonotes5
"He said Israel would back increased""economic pressure and a psychological campaign""against the government of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is a sworn enemy of Israel.",ontonotes5
""" I do not think Israel has a problem with Iran; it has a problem with Ahmadinejad,""Peres said.",ontonotes5
"Peres said that there is""a great deal of dissatisfaction inside Iran""with the policies of Ahmadinejad.",ontonotes5
"Iran's neighbors in the Gulf expressed their concern over Iran's nuclear plans, and Saudi officials said that an Iran which owns nuclear weapons could spur a regional arms race.",ontonotes5
Peres was the most senior Israeli official to visit Doha in 1996 when he opened a trade office in the country.,ontonotes5
There are no official diplomatic relations with Qatar.,ontonotes5
"Qatar and several other Arab countries ended an economic ban on Israel after it signed interim peace agreements with the Palestinians in 1993, but relations deteriorated after the outbreak of the uprising in 2000.",ontonotes5
"Al-Wajba salutes you and says: Passing by the Saudi airspace, Peres arrived in Qatar for a short visit to the Qatar Debates program with a special invitation since there will be a miniature democratic seminar to study and discuss a number of issues and the ways of tackling them...",ontonotes5
Qatar's reception for Shimon Peres came from this angle.. addressing the mind and conversing to create a solution for many pending matters and also to make the Qatari public in particular and the Arab public in general understand what takes place in a democratic atmosphere..,ontonotes5
"In Qatar there are many independent universities, both Arab and international, and there are branches of well established international universities.",ontonotes5
He also sought to establish a deterrent nuclear program since Israel owns the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world.,ontonotes5
We also find that most of the Arab people and some Gulf people live below the poverty line..,ontonotes5
"Furthermore, most of the presidents of the Arab and Gulf states do not have any high scientific degree or any sound plan to build a strong country at the scientific level..",ontonotes5
"They do not even have any interest in education or in establishing strong universities in the first place, except for Qatar.",ontonotes5
His Highness the Prince receives the man of peace in Israel in an attempt to bring Hamas and Israel together.,ontonotes5
All this in consultation with Hamas in Syria and Palestine so as to bring views closer..,ontonotes5

"He said that he considered the statement of former American President Jimmy Carter on Israel's oppression of the Palestinians a grave mistake, and he stressed that Carter should withdraw these opinions.",ontonotes5

Discussion of the Arab-Israeli situation by the students in a unique democratic oasis in Qatar.,ontonotes5
"I think, in my opinion, that if democracy in some of the neighboring countries is non-existent in the simplest matters related to their personal rights and the demand for them. Then how could they reach to the level of Qatar in gathering this huge number of intellectuals, politicians, and heads of state to discuss sensitive issues that concern the Arab World?",ontonotes5
"After Qatar went beyond local democracy and human rights in the country.. praise God and many thanks to His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who established democracy and freedom in the country.. and made Qatar a platform for dialogue.. so the discussion took place in Qatar.",ontonotes5
"Conversely, as a result of the lack of freedom among the Arab people we find that it is America which is in the driver's seat and steers guests wherever it wants and takes them on tours without any questioning directed at it.",ontonotes5
"All this marginalizes the Arab individual as though he had no -LRB- mind -RRB- or -LRB- opinion -RRB-, and you find that the areas he is allowed to talk about are women driving in Saudi Arabia and similar useless topics..",ontonotes5
"It was announced in the newspapers that Peres would visit Qatar, and it was announced in the three Qatari newspapers.",ontonotes5
There are writers in Qatar who have positive opinions as well as negative opinions.,ontonotes5
This name is used by 17 people from three Gulf States!,ontonotes5
The girls of Qatar shake hands with the dirty Jewish men?,ontonotes5
If we could agree that we fall behind the Zionists and Americans in such fields... however the problem lies in ignoring all this clear evidence that the scientific project is nothing but a small misleading part of a campaign meant to change the Islamic Gulf and Qatari identity and to remove its established fixed principles in which they surpass everything that the Zionists and the Americans have.,ontonotes5
So... the purely scientific and technological side can not justify what is happening in Qatar.,ontonotes5
The most important of them is supporting the truth and loyalty to Muslims even if it goes against narrow personal interests... and the relationship of Saudi Arabia with the Americans...,ontonotes5
"Despite my being convinced that it should be limited after the latter's aggression, it does not in any way reach the level of the relationship of Qatar with the Americans themselves.",ontonotes5
-LRB- The tension in the relations with Saudi Arabia recently and the military base on the Qatari territory despite the state of peace in the region are evidence of that -RRB-...,ontonotes5
So how come Qatar is now adding to this with intimate relations with those whose existence and history and reality are entirely connected to aggression against Muslims.. namely the Zionists!!?,ontonotes5
What is happening in Qatar is a political and intellectual penetration in the countries of the region in every meaning of the word..,ontonotes5

"Prince Al-Waleed explained that the remaining five billion were invested in the property sector that included the Riyadh project which will be launched in the first quarter of the current financial year, and the Jeddah project which will be launched at the beginning of the coming year indicating that an area of 165 million square meters of land had actually been purchased by the Kingdom Holding Company in Riyadh and another area of 53 million square meters in Jeddah for the establishment of these two projects. and a study undertaken to turn these property companies in the future into ones publicly listed on the share market.",ontonotes5
The total costs of the Jeddah project is expected to amount to approximately 50 billion riyals and will turn the map of the town upside down.,ontonotes5
"Speaking of the Riyadh project, Prince Al-Waleed said that it is situated on the Dammam road.",ontonotes5
"With the revival of the petro-market and the increase in the Kingdom's revenue, both of the government or the citizens, there was a lot of money and limited investment opportunities ,",ontonotes5

"Using a funny expression he says:""The difficulty is that no one can prevent women from traveling to Abu Dhabi, so there is nothing left to do but to pray that the team loses in the worst defeat so that the flow of women will automatically stop or that the cheerleaders become afflicted with paralysis or rickets.

"But what is disgraceful and shameful is to welcome such dishonorable sights, shameful clothes, unrestrained hair, and swaying, while we see girls from the UAE and Kuwait in the grandstand of their teams looking respectable and modest, with some of them covering their faces!",ontonotes5
"Female Saudi cheerleaders or hirelings -LRB- anything is possible -RRB- previously cheered for the team in Kuwait, but in a more decent and better way than what is happening now.",ontonotes5

"I remember that once Qatar hired Moroccan women in one of its celebrations in order to play the role of Gulf girls, meaning that in each song about a Gulf state, they let girls dance.

The elite are the people of Qatar.,ontonotes5
"That is, the one who hired them-for something in his mind-brought them more than one hour before the first match of the Iraqi team against the Bahraini team, and they did not leave the stadium until after the match between Saudi Arabia and Qatar.",ontonotes5
The second: a Saudi woman devoid of bashfulness who has not been brought up well by her parents and lived outside Saudi Arabia more than she lived inside it.,ontonotes5
"Finally, I say: -LRB- The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was established on the basis of the words of God, on the words of His messenger, and on the application of the religion of God and the Sunna of His messenger -LRB- may God bless him and grant him salvation -RRB-. This way of doing things will not change in spite of the liberals, so it is better for them to pursue al-Qusaybi, Khalid al-Harbi, and others whom purity and virtuousness do not suit, and who want to graze like cattle in every corrupt world. -RRB-",ontonotes5

Dr. Faisal Al Qassem How foolish we were in our look to Iran.,ontonotes5
"But I do not know where those historic characteristics of chess suddenly evaporated in Iranian policy, when the governing organization in Tehran blessed the deed of its agents in Iraq to execute the deceased Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, on the first day of the holy Eid Al Adha, mutilating his body, swearing and calling him names with profanity while he was on the gallows rope, when Saddam himself had ordered the Iraqi media after the death of Khomeini, to use the phrase""May god have mercy on him. """,ontonotes5
"Some might forgive Iran for its yearning to see Saddam Hussein hanged, as a type of retaliation and revenge, especially as it had fought him for eight long years, in which it suffered hundreds of thousands of souls and extreme losses.",ontonotes5
"But no doubt, since it is strengthening its grip on Al Hakeem, Al Maliki, Al Sadr, and Al Jaafari, who are holding the neck of an injured Iraq, it could have picked another more wise and less damaging time, for itself and for Muslims in general, to retaliate against its old rival, rather than committing a terrible deed that Arabs, and even all Sunnis, would not forgive it for tens of years, hanging him on what is a holy day for the utmost majority of Muslims.",ontonotes5
"I do not know how Iran fell in that dangerous trap, even if it were an evil American one, as it is known about Iranians that they are smarter than to fall into American traps, no matter how cleverly and wittingly they are set.",ontonotes5
"If I were in the place of the wise ones of Iran, I would hang the Iranian politicians who blessed the execution of President Saddam Hussein on the day of the holy Eid Al Adha.",ontonotes5
"We all know that Iran can just hint to Abd Al Aziz Al Hakim, who wanted to compensate it with a hundred billion dollars from the aliment of the Iraqi people for its war with Iraq, or to the fascist militia leaders like the Sadr militia, which implemented the execution judgment with the recognition of the Iraqi government, to postpone the hanging, especially as the Americans had confirmed that they were against the execution on the holy day.",ontonotes5
"Even if the American ambassador in Iraq is a liar and wants to create division between the Shiites and the Sunnis that would have terrible repercussions, the Iranians could have prevented the implementation of the judgment on the first day of Eid Al Adha, in order to avoid the dangerous repercussions for which they will pay the price for tens of years, and in order to pull the carpet from beneath some of the Arab regimes which they now accuse of provocation against the Shiites.",ontonotes5
"On one hand, they barbarically offend the feelings of more than eighty-five percent of the world's Muslims, the Sunnis, and on the other hand, they accuse some Islamic countries of sectarian provocation against Iran, as the Iranians and their allies in the region complain that there are obvious attempts to wedge and create division between the Shiites and the Sunnis on the part of America, Israel, and some Arabs.",ontonotes5
"but if Iran does not really want to inflame grudges between the Shiites and the Sunnis and seeks to unite the Islamic front and prevent its penetration on the part of the Zionists and Americans, as it claims, why did it give the green light to its agents and militias in Iraq to execute Saddam Hussein on Eid Al Adha and provide justifications on a golden plate for those who want to break down Muslims on a sectarian basis?",ontonotes5
"The story of Iran is similar to the story of the one who beat me and cried, and preceded me and complained.",ontonotes5
Hasn't the provocation against Iran become justified after the shameful Adha deed?,ontonotes5
"If the betrayed Iraqi President knew how he had become in the eyes of the Islamic world after his execution, he might have weighed for the Iranians and their agents in Iraq tons of praise and commendation for the great favor they did for him, of which he had never dreamed.",ontonotes5
"But now that Iran and its agents have executed him in this horrible way, he has entered history by its widest doors, after he had exited history years ago.",ontonotes5
"A few months ago, Iran was a symbol of resistance, jihad, dignity, and challenge, thanks to its support of Arab resistance movements like Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine, while the popularity of the Arab regimes was hitting rock bottom.",ontonotes5
The Iranians had the right to be proud of the glorious victory Hezbollah achieved over Israel.,ontonotes5

"I heard a lot of people connecting the Persian enemy and the Zionist enemy, while Iran, until months ago, was the striker in confronting the Zionist and American project in the region.",ontonotes5
Iran caused great embarrassment for everyone who has supported its positions in the past.,ontonotes5
"I have heard from a lot of people who used to defend Iran in the Arab street, and they have totally turned against it and started to call it""dirty Persian""with a lot of loathing and hatred.",ontonotes5
"In recent months, Hezbollah's performance in the war with Israel, with Iranian President Ahmadinejad's announcements, speeches, challenge of the American administration, and his insistence on finishing the process of enriching uranium, used to resurrect pride and dignity in the souls of millions of Arabs and Muslims.",ontonotes5
"But the scene of Saddam's execution turned the tables upside down on Iran for a time that might last for long; let alone the horrible offense to Hezbollah, which lost a big portion of the street.",ontonotes5
"The proof is that its biggest supporters in Jordan, for example, boycotted the Manar Channel, which used to have great popularity in the Arab street.",ontonotes5
"No matter how the answers vary, as Mohamed Abu Roman debates, what is obvious is that the image of Saddam Hussein's execution would cost Iran a lot in the next stage.",ontonotes5
"In addition, it revealed that the""Persian-national""spirit that tinctures Iran's foreign policy and its various positions, far from the claims of enmity to America and Israel, are only used to serve Iran's interests.",ontonotes5
"Beyond that, the image of executing Saddam and the repercussions it created cause a large embarrassment for Iran's allies in the region, like Hamas, Al Jihad, Syria, and many Islamic factions, as well as the political and public powers-in the Arab countries-which stood with Hezbollah and were calling for their governments to""change""their alliances to stand with Iran instead of the United States and Israel.",ontonotes5

"Unfortunately, the government is concerned with consultations behind the scenes with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and with the American advisers more than it is interested in bringing about the right climate inside Iraq for exhaustive discussions ending with a calm decision in the interests of the nation.",ontonotes5
"However, the government seems subject to the United States ' dictates that have expressed in various ways its insistence on handing over the Iraqi oil resources to foreign companies as one of the main aims of the Occupation.",ontonotes5

Much journalistic noise was raised abroad about the subject of the oil and the distribution of its revenues to the different areas of Iraq.,ontonotes5

"The fact is that the oil revenues are still passing through""The Iraq Development Fund""under the supervision of the United Nations and the United States in accordance with the Security Council resolutions and, consequently, any agreement between the central government and the regions about the distribution of oil revenues will be subject to the guarantee of the US hegemony.",ontonotes5
"The subject of oil from a sectarian or regional point of view was not presented except as a cover for the important main questions about the oil policy, these being Firstly: the abrogation of Act 80 -LRB- 1961 -RRB- and its cancellation, by successively handing over unexploited oilfields and areas to foreign companies on the basis of long-term participation in production contracts, instead of developing them nationally by supporting the national oil companies and making use of foreign expertise through short-term service contracts that would leave the wealth in Iraq's hands. Secondly: the weakening of the Iraq's negotiating power by weakening the centralization of contracting for the national resources with foreign companies and the instruments of such contracting; not distinguishing between the need to expand the administrative powers of the companies and institutions on the one hand, and the need for the centralization of the major national economic decisions on the other.",ontonotes5

"It is unreasonable for us to seek solutions to the electricity problem for each governorate, or that we have local water policies in Mesopotamia.",ontonotes5

"Also, the main economic problems in Iraq currently do not lie in the diminished oil revenue, but in the occupation, the security situation, the widespread corruption and theft, the dissolution of the state, the loss of the oil resources and the breakdown of economic activity.",ontonotes5
"The responsibility lies in particular on the shoulders of the members of the current National Assembly, notwithstanding their loyalties, and they must ask themselves: if the Kuwaiti National Council has been opposing for years the foreign oil investment project in Kuwait, and if Saudi Arabia and Iran are still holding to the nationalization of oil in their countries, are they ready to revoke Act No. 80?",ontonotes5

"Within days, Abather and Balqes had sold off their belongings and fled to Amman.",ontonotes5
"The U.S. Embassy in Amman is an attractive, Arabian-style fortress, heavily guarded machine-gunners in Ford pickups.",ontonotes5

"At its edges, in dank apartments on outlying hillsides, lives a substantial portion of Baghdad's educated middle class.",ontonotes5
"Of Iraq's 27 million prewar population, about 1 in 8--some 3.4 million people--have left their homes since the invasion, according to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees -LRB- unhcr -RRB- ,",ontonotes5

``The people who have fled are the ones the administration was relying on to build democracy in Iraq;,ontonotes5
It was in Jordan that Abather and Balqes discovered the limitations of their friendship with the United States.,ontonotes5

he 'd even offered to sponsor their relocation ``to the safety of the United States.'',ontonotes5
"Since 9/ 11, Middle Easterners in general, and Iraqis in particular, have faced enormous hurdles getting admitted to the United States;",ontonotes5
"Several months later they were notified that they could visit the United States for up to three months, but that they could not bring their children.",ontonotes5
"As it has with almost 99 percent of the Iraqis who have come through its office in Amman, the agency turned them down.",ontonotes5
"Abather and Balqes set their sights on a visa to Australia, a major destination for Iraqi refugees, and even hired an Iraqi lawyer there.",ontonotes5
"In early June 2006, Abather got a rejection letter from Australia.",ontonotes5
"So he went back to Iraq to bury his father, help his mother find a place to live, and buy state-subsidized medicine for his daughter.",ontonotes5
"Having recently suffered two terrorist attacks, Jordan had enacted a ban on entry for Iraqi men aged 17 to 35.",ontonotes5
"Finally, a guard promised to send the medicine to his family in Amman if he would just go away.",ontonotes5
Once again Abather headed back to Baghdad.,ontonotes5
"Driving in Baghdad a few days later, he noticed a bmw--the Iraqi gangster's vehicle of choice--in his rearview mirror, closing in.",ontonotes5
"Abather recognized the voice of one man, an acquaintance from Iraqi Village who had seemed to befriend the Americans.",ontonotes5
"Soon, a bearded imam sentenced Abather to decapitation for collaborating with the United States.",ontonotes5
``I was thinking the whole time about my little daughter in Amman.'',ontonotes5
He woke up in a hospital bed 60 miles from Baghdad;,ontonotes5
"His brother--who had received a ransom note from the kidnappers, complete with a photo of Abather bound and gagged--brought him back to Baghdad, where doctors fused a piece of plastic onto his shin and grafted skin from his thighs over his wounds.",ontonotes5
"On a crisp, clear day this past December, clutching a sheaf of papers documenting Abather and Balqes ' ordeal--contracts, soldiers ' recommendations, death threats, a missing-person report--I headed to American Citizen Services at the U.S. Embassy in Amman.",ontonotes5
"Outside the embassy, I joined a chatty, eclectic crowd of Americans: a retired hippie turned English teacher from Vermont; a woman with a New York accent who struggled through the narrow eye-slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter; a white-bearded man in a Santa hat, who said he was picking up his passport before returning to the North Pole.",ontonotes5

She handed me a document outlining Congress ' sole concession to people like Abather and Balqes: visas for up to 50 military translators from Iraq or Afghanistan each year.,ontonotes5
"Philip A. Frayne, an embassy spokesman in Amman, told me that ``there are no reliable figures'' on how many people have fled Iraq, and that in any case, it was Saddam who drove out ``a large percentage'' of them.",ontonotes5
"The report ignored the fact that, according to a survey by the nonprofit U.S. Committee for Refugees, 644,500 new refugees entered Jordan and Syria in 2005 alone.",ontonotes5
"As much as a quarter of greater Amman's population is now Iraqi ,",ontonotes5
"Incidentally, Human Rights Watch has also called upon the Gulf Arab states to pitch in;",ontonotes5
Saudi Arabia's response so far has been to plan construction of a 560-mile wall along its border with Iraq.,ontonotes5
"Before I left Jordan, Abather invited me to visit his family and a physician friend from Baghdad who shares their two-room basement apartment.",ontonotes5
"On the Al Zawraa TV channel from Baghdad, we watched U.S. Army vehicles disappear behind roadside bomb blasts as a man sang, ``Let's go kill the Americans!''",ontonotes5

"In 1976, when Jimmy Carter took the Presidency from Gerald Ford, outgoing Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld went off to seek corporate wealth as head of G.D. Searle, a Skokie pharmaceutical company.",ontonotes5
"His period running the business, inherited by the family of his North Shore friend and early backer Dan Searle, would become part of Rumsfeld's legend of success as a master manager, negligently accepted as fact by the media and Congressional representatives at his 2001 confirmation hearings.",ontonotes5
"In looking at men of prominence like Rumsfeld who revolve in and out of the private sector, the Washington media almost invariably adopts the press-release or booster business-page version of events from what inside-the-Beltway types call ``the real world.''",ontonotes5
"In the documented version of reality, derived from litigation and relatively obscure investigations in the U.S. and abroad, Searle turned out to enjoy its notable rise less thanks to Rumsfeldian innovative managerial genius than to old-fashioned reckless marketing of pharmaceuticals already on the shelf and the calling in of lobbying ``markers'' via its well-connected Republican CEO.",ontonotes5
"A case in point was Searle's anti-diarrhea medicine Lomotil, sold ever more widely and profitably internationally -LRB- in industry terms ``dumped'' -RRB---especially in Africa in the late 1970s--despite the company's failure to warn of its potentially dire effects on younger children.",ontonotes5
"Part of the vast outrage of multinational ``pharmas'' exploiting the Third World, the company under Rumsfeld would, like the more publicized Upjohn with its Depo-Provera, be implicated in widespread bribery of officials -LRB- and others -RRB- in poorer countries to promote the sale of oral contraceptives which had been found unsafe for American or European women.",ontonotes5
"As Rumsfeld took over in Skokie, the FDA was taking the rare step of recommending to Justice Department prosecutors that a grand jury investigate the company's applications for FDA approval for ``willful and knowing failure to make reports. concealing material facts and making false statements'' in connection with the statutory application process required by law and FDA standards.",ontonotes5
"By the time litigation would be filed, the United States was already 18 months into the occupation of Iraq.",ontonotes5
The one exception to his involuntary Reagan-era exile from government would be a stint in 1983 as special presidential envoy to the Middle East.,ontonotes5
"He would be sent to arrange U.S. support for Saddam Hussein's Iraq in its war with the hated Iranians of Ayatollah Khomeini, a role little noticed at the time which nonetheless produced the notorious photo of Rumsfeld shaking hands with the Iraqi dictator.",ontonotes5
"In general, Rumsfeld put his shoulder to the wheel to shore up the war-worn Baathist regime that had attacked Iran in 1980.",ontonotes5
"Their dereliction was assured, in part, by the general animus toward Iran on a Capitol Hill then effectively controlled by the Republicans, and increasingly under the bipartisan influence of the growing Israeli lobby and its Tel Aviv handlers.",ontonotes5
"The lobby quietly, cynically pushed both for Reagan administration aid to Iraq and for covert arms-dealing with Iran -LRB- later exposed in the Iran-Contra scandal -RRB-, viewing the ongoing no-winners carnage of two Islamic states as a boon.",ontonotes5
"At the same time, in the intelligence briefings he received as the first ranking U.S. official to go to Iraq since the Baghdad Pact of the 1950s, he would have been uniquely aware, as no other senior figure in Washington, of the brutal character of Saddam Hussein's regime and, in particular, the sectarian, regional, tribal, and clan politics that lay behind it.",ontonotes5
"The Ba'athists were a government, after all, that the CIA itself had helped to recruit and install in the coup of 1963, reinstalled in 1968 when the Agency's original clients lost control, and then watched closely while Baghdad had a flirtation -LRB- involving an arms-supply relationship -RRB- with the feared Russians -LRB- whose influence the bloody 1963 coup was supposed to counter -RRB-.",ontonotes5
This was particularly true in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli War of 1973 with its peace agreements from which Iraq emerged as a principal remaining challenge to Israel.,ontonotes5
"By 1983, the volatile, complex currents of Iraq's political culture, Saddam's essentially family and clan rule, and the now crude, now subtle layering of Sunni and Shia in the Ba'athist bureaucracy and plutocracy, as well as the wartime distrust and savage repression of a suspect, subordinate Shia majority, were well known to outside intelligence agencies as well as scholars and journalists.",ontonotes5
"The CIA, DIA and State Department Bureaus of Near Eastern Affairs and Intelligence and Research--and certainly Rumsfeld as presidential envoy--also had reason to understand much about Saddam's grandiose ambition, in Iraq's old rivalry with Egypt, to lead a pan-Arab nationalist renaissance to some kind of future parity with Israel's nuclear-armed military might.",ontonotes5
"In addition to the usual extensive intelligence-sharing with Israel's Mossad, less than two years before Rumsfeld's Iraq mission CIA operatives had literally lit the way for Israeli F fighter bombers in their June 1981 surprise attack on Saddam's fledgling nuclear reactor at Osiraq.",ontonotes5
"From some 400 scientists and technicians with$ 400 million in funding, that program would grow to perhaps 7,000 scientists and technicians with as much as$ 10 billion at their command, some of which was indirectly made possible by the bounty Rumsfeld carried to Baghdad in the mid-1980s",ontonotes5
"For anyone dealing seriously with these issues, there could have been little doubt that Saddam would use the considerable aid and trade Rumsfeld was sliding his way under the table to mount a better-armed, more bloody war on Iran, to further the regime's most ambitious dreams of weapons development, and to tyrannize all the more savagely potentially rebellious Iraqi Shiites and Kurds.",ontonotes5
"Long afterward, as some of the ugly essence of his mission to Baghdad dribbled out amid the ruins of Bush's Iraqi occupation, Rumsfeld would be faulted for pandering to, and appeasing, Saddam -LRB- whose gassing of the Kurds had already begun -RRB---in the wake of a single, timorous, hypocritical statement issued in Washington in March 1984 criticizing his use of chemical weapons.",ontonotes5
"So, too, of course, could Saddam's brutal 1980s repression of the Shia, underlying the sectarian animus and resolve for vengeance and dominance by the U.S.-installed Shia regime after 2003 that shaped Rumsfeld's, and America's, historic failure in Iraq.",ontonotes5
Others colluded at every turn in the long scandal of policy toward Iraq.,ontonotes5
"While Reagan's special envoy was, with his usual energy and sharp elbows, dickering with the Iraqis in the mid-1980s, Condoleezza Rice was an assistant professor of no scholarly distinction at Stanford; Cheney a third-term congressman from Wyoming squirming up the House leadership ladder; future viceroy of Baghdad L. Paul ``Jerry'' Bremer moving from State Department clerk and Alexander Haig protege to lavish-party giving ambassador to the Netherlands; and George W. Bush, still by his own account given to ``heavy drinking ,'' absorbed in changing the name of his chronically failed Arbusto Energy oil company to Bush Exploration.",ontonotes5
"In 1990, he joined the board of ABB, a Swedish-Swiss conglomerate that had gobbled up companies in the latter 1980s, including Westinghouse energy operations, and would move aggressively to win a$ 200-million contract for ``the design and key components'' for light-water nuclear reactors in North Korea.",ontonotes5
Rumsfeld pursued this prize even while chairing a Congressional commission on missile threats that found a ``clear danger'' for the future from Pyongyang.,ontonotes5
"In July 1998, there followed the ``Rumsfeld Commission'' report on missile threats, wildly claiming, in an unnamed debut of the ``axis of evil'' drawn from the testimony and staff work of right-wing ideologues, that Iran, Iraq, and North Korea would each be able to ``inflict major destruction'' on the U.S. by 2002.",ontonotes5
"In any case, the elder Bush had erased him from his son's list of possible running mates, while ultimately waving through Cheney, whose reactionary animus had been relatively well masked at the Pentagon in 1989.",ontonotes5
"The supposed party of national security, having held the White House for five of the last eight terms and dominated Congress for much of the previous 30 years, had no serious alternative to a man who had perched atop the Pentagon a full quarter-century before.",ontonotes5
"There was speculation that the old Halloween Massacre goal was still there, that Cheney, with his uncertain health, might step aside in 2004, that the undertaker might yet reach the Oval Office.",ontonotes5
"Like Osama bin Laden, steely-haired Nikolai Ogarkov first came to light during the Soviet war in Afghanistan.",ontonotes5
His vision soon gained vogue as much in Washington as amid the stultified upper reaches of the Soviet military of the early 1980s.,ontonotes5
"This was particularly so among the Soviets, whose rusty Europe-heavy military was already being shaken and bled in Afghanistan by the Mujahideen--in 1982, despite ample Saudi money, still only partially armed by their cynical CIA, Pakistani, and Chinese handlers.",ontonotes5
"An economist by training, he had begun at RAND as an analyst in the late 1940s, when Rumsfeld was still in New Trier High School.",ontonotes5
"While the U.S. armaments spree of the 1980s paid for some new RMA developments, most of the expenditures fit snugly within the corrupt, obtuse old Cold War system, with America's armed forces tailored to a lumbering Soviet threat in Europe, and no serious anticipation of the neo-insurgency wars that actually lay ahead.",ontonotes5
"As Marshall toyed with ``flexibility''--and the Joint Chiefs cherry-picked his conjuring of Moscow's might for their own budgetary purposes, while ignoring the real import, and limits, of RMA--the Cold War ended in the equivocations and evasions of Bill Clinton's two terms in office and the low-rent, self-congratulatory installing of mafia regimes in Bosnia and Kosovo.",ontonotes5
"The willing ignorance, denial, careless trust, or craven acquiescence that marked the essential submissiveness of the political and media culture to Rumsfeld's rule were only part of a larger, thoughtless national abdication of judgment and responsibility in the wars he would propel in both Afghanistan and Iraq.",ontonotes5
"In blindly striking out after 9/ 11--a reflexive, grandly opportunistic, richly self-satisfying political act in America--without seriously understanding the politics or history of either country, he plunged the Pentagon into blundering, plundering occupations that made the nightmares of 2007 and beyond nearly inevitable.",ontonotes5
"All of it was plain in Washington soon after George W. Bush's arrival in the Oval Office; none of it was then questioned, much less challenged, by Congress, the remnant foreign policy establishment, or the mainstream media.",ontonotes5
No democratic process so completely failed a test of substance as America's after 9/ 11.,ontonotes5
"He opened government as never before to men who habitually, automatically assumed that U.S. and Israeli interests were identical, with no objectivity about American policy in a Middle East they scarcely understood to begin with.",ontonotes5
"Half-educated and fanatically loyal to the rote Israeli lobby view of the Middle East and the larger neocon craze for American post-Cold War global hegemony, they crowded the domains of the number three official at the Pentagon, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith, whose career was a model of their kind and whose notorious Office of Special Plans was created as a fount for the fraudulent intelligence spurring the invasion of Iraq.",ontonotes5
Never before--not even in the post-World War II heyday of the powerful China Lobby with its formidable grip on Capitol Hill but not within the upper reaches of the Executive itself--had so many of such uncritical adherence to the policies of a foreign power been so well placed in Washington.,ontonotes5
"The calamity in Iraq has brought more public criticism by senior officers than any other war in American history, including Vietnam, but almost all of it hurled from the relatively safe seats of two-and three-star retirement--and forlornly after the fact.",ontonotes5
"In the exhilarating dash to Baghdad in 2003, none of the admiring gallery seemed to notice that Rumsfeld's ``new'' military was largely the old one, ``reformed'' in name only; nor did many note that the vaunted lean, mean machine of RMA and the again-lionized Marshall had no grasp of how profoundly political was the act of overthrowing 40 years of Ba rule; how deeply political was the campaign to which so many American lives, so much of the country's material and symbolic national treasures, would be committed.",ontonotes5
Rumsfeld would take his victory tour in the Gulf that spring as if circling the mat after a stunningly swift pin.,ontonotes5
"Unreformed, uninformed commanders, uninstructed beyond brief battles, led their charges into Iraq relying on their generals.",ontonotes5
"The exiles--holed up in Baghdad palaces with U.S.-paid-for mercenary guards, ignorant and contemptuous of the Iraq that had passed them by, and where they were now powerless, even with the might of the Pentagon behind them--relied on the Americans.",ontonotes5
The ranks trusted him--and political decision-makers--to know and manage post-Saddam politics in Iraq to secure the victory as well as to provide the political setting that fulfilled the military triumph.,ontonotes5
Not since the British hired hordes of Hessians to crush George Washington's revolutionary army had a military force tracing to America been so utterly mercenary.,ontonotes5
"With the ready sanctioning, and then de facto cover-up of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and the less noticed but equally gruesome prisons at Bagram Air Base and elsewhere in Afghanistan, he changed, for untold millions, the symbol of America and its once-proud military from freedom and the rule of law to the unforgettable prisoner's hood and shackles.",ontonotes5
"At the end, a pathetic climax to his more than four decades either in government or imploringly on its threshold, there was only his hackneyed memo on Iraq policy--leaked, even more pathetically, in an apparent attempt somehow to vindicate him after all.",ontonotes5
"Thus, he growled that the Iraqi regime, like some seedy wrestling team, should ``pull up its socks''; and, most poignantly, ever the politician conducting lethal policy as politics, he advised that Washington ``announce that whatever new approach the US decides on, the US is doing so on a trial basis.",ontonotes5
"As a pathologically unfit president struggled to recoup his historic blunder, as the neocons and Israeli lobby pressed on a gullible media and restive but still captive Congress the myth of an Iranian nuclear threat, as the Navy and Air Force, lesser actors in the Iraq action, promised wondrous results in Persia, the chaos and ineffable danger were left to Robert Gates, the puffy courtier.",ontonotes5
"Roger Morris, who served in the State Department and on the Senior Staff of the National Security Council under Presidents Johnson and Nixon, resigned in protest at the invasion of Cambodia.",ontonotes5

What's consistently overlooked in the debate ovre 288 is what else that$ 400 million could have been spent on.,ontonotes5
Even those of us who are isolated from the NoVA local economy understand the need to have transportation facilities so people can go to and from work.,ontonotes5
What they don't point out is that Georgetown sits on the site of a former Hazel family farm.,ontonotes5
"When you look at the Ballston Corridor, those high rises were essentially subdivided from property formerly owned as single family homes.",ontonotes5
"Yet, that's not how Virginia funds transportation infrastructure.",ontonotes5
-LRB- I have a good friend who attended a meeting in Richmond where a famous developer stood up and told the crowd that he built things and its was the taxpayers ' job to pay for the infrastructure to support whatever he built.,ontonotes5
That's the Virginia way. -RRB-,ontonotes5
Look at the roads that Disney and others built in Florida.,ontonotes5
"My criticism is not just for roads, but also for extending Metro to Dulles at a huge cost that will not improve",ontonotes5
"The table shows several roads with LOS F that, after spending billions on Metro, are still LOS F.",ontonotes5
"I agree that Metro to Dulles won't do a thing for traffic congestion ,",ontonotes5
"But clearly, using tolls to pay for Metro -LRB- instead of road improvements -RRB- while simultaneously claiming that cars and roads don't pay their way is both nutso and egregiously unfair.",ontonotes5
"I wonder how the Journal would interpret news from the Washington Post today that Del. David B. Albo, R-Springfield and a number of other GOP delegates would like to raise an estimated$ 400 million a year from Northern Virginia to spend on local road and rail projects.",ontonotes5
"While most GOP delegates were willing to hang together to oppose a statewide tax increase, there seems to be little appreciation of the root causes of transportation dysfunction in Virginia.",ontonotes5
Reducing the costs of the congestion tax is the only way to advance the Virginia's economy.,ontonotes5

London had parking restrictions in the 1600's.,ontonotes5
"Zoning was developed in New York to encourage people to move out of the city center, subsidized by flat fares on the trolleys.",ontonotes5
"``of us should delude ourselves, however, that the road problem of Virginia... will be solved at least for many years.",ontonotes5
"Virginia has started tinkering with a number of these, but has not systematically explored any of them.",ontonotes5
Most people in NoVA want an adequate public facilities ordinance and don't believe that anything related to transportation is anything more than another way to foster more development.,ontonotes5
-LRB- Kaine made his ``promise'' with full knowledge of the power of the builders in Virginia. -RRB-,ontonotes5
"No one trusts any Virginia elected official on land use issues, especially given Kaine's switch and Gerry Connolly's wholesale giveaways to the developers.",ontonotes5
-LRB- How about$ 43 million plus in Fairfax County taxpayer subsidies to land development and zoning services since ``Condo Connolly'' took over the BoS chair? -RRB-,ontonotes5
People in NoVA want an end to policies that support growth without regard to the impacts on current residents.,ontonotes5
I'll oppose any transfer of more money from NoVA taxpayers until we get APF.'',ontonotes5
people whose costs include supporting the Dulles Toll road are also supporting the transit that will make it possible for future residents to live in transit friendly neighborhoods.,ontonotes5
"When Virginia does systematically explore these ideas they may very well come to the conclusion that Fundamental Change is a really lousy idea, and that, bad as it is, business as usual is the best option after all.",ontonotes5
"APF's are a good idea only if you are willing to provide a dedicated and adequate funding stream for them, same as for Metro.",ontonotes5
Will the last ones out ``free market'' Virginia please turn out the lights on your way to North Carolina?,ontonotes5
it is OK for the general public or auto drivers -LRB- which is much the same thing -RRB- to provide some support for transit because there is some -LRB- small -RRB- benefit to everyone for those that are able and willing to use Metro etc.,ontonotes5
"Not only is Virginia heading for a fiscal crisis, but it may be heading for a constitutional crisis as well.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, senior state lawmakers are due to visit bond rating agencies in New York.",ontonotes5
"Virginia may be the best managed state in the country when the politicians are actually speaking to one another, but it's not looking terribly well managed right now.",ontonotes5
"Only two years ago, on the heels of the last recession, Virginia's political class was consternated that the state's AAA bond rating might be cut.",ontonotes5
"Wouldn't it be ironic if, despite the 2004 tax increase and a$ 1.5 billion surplus, the rating agencies cut Virginia's bond rating anyway this year?",ontonotes5
The phony bond crisis of 04 was that Virginia could ' only ' borrow$ 800 m if the Commonwealth wanted to do so.,ontonotes5
"We in Virginia drank the Kool-aid and elected a bunch of culture warrior idealogues instead of good, pragmatic stewards.",ontonotes5
To see this going on in Virginia now is truly an embarrassment.,ontonotes5

"no one to handle the patients at the state REGULAR hospitals-MCV, UVA, etc.",ontonotes5
the Science Museum in Richmond would be closed,ontonotes5

I'll also predict... that the classic fall-back position for Virginia is the same one used by the Feds -,ontonotes5
"``The Pocahontas Parkway, a state-owned toll road that opened four years ago on Richmond's outskirts, has been a financial flop.",ontonotes5
"That an Australian company has agreed to spend$ 522 million on Pocahontas Parkway, a road that last year collected just$ 10.3 million in tolls.",ontonotes5
"In exchange for the right to keep all parkway toll revenue, Transurban agreed to build a 1.6-mile, four-lane road to the Richmond International Airport, pending federal approval.",ontonotes5
So... I 'd ask... why not replicate this approach to some of our more urgent transportation problems and get VDOT and the State of Virginia out of the business of collecting taxes... and apparently not knowing how to build even toll roads that will be cost-effective?,ontonotes5
"BUT, if we shut down the Virginia state government, that IS what will happen.",ontonotes5
the public health staff of the state and localities of Virginia -LRB- most are state employees even if they are working in your local county-ask if you don't believe -RRB-,ontonotes5

A Toll Road in U.S. 460's Future,ontonotes5
"Private industry is showing interest in financing and building a new U.S. 460, Peter Bacque with the Richmond Times-Dispatch is reporting.",ontonotes5
"Tidewater Skanska, a subsidiary of Swedish construction giant Skanska AB, has committed to making a proposal to improve the 55-mile highway between U.S. 58 in Suffolk and Interstate 295 near Petersburg.",ontonotes5
"Needless to say, residents of hamlets like Zuni and Wakefield who use 460 as a local thoroughfare will be none too happy with paying tolls every time they pull onto the road.",ontonotes5
but they could well be tied to major port expansions slated for Hampton Roads.,ontonotes5
"Moffat & Nichol, an engineering consulting firm, prepared a study for the Virginia Port Authority last year advocating development of a major intermodal park off U.S. 460 as a way to handle an anticipated 900,000 additional containers annually expected to move through the ports.",ontonotes5
And I'm all in favor of a project that would enable the expansion of Virginia's ports and improve employment prospects for the rural Southside counties along U.S. 460.,ontonotes5
"But I'm also wary of the potential for an upgraded U.S. 460 to act as a wick for the expansion of more hop-scotch, disconnected, low-density development out of Hampton Roads--a pattern of development that would negate many of the benefits of the economic development.",ontonotes5
So take a private investor.. any private investor who ``proposes'' to build a major road-like 460-and folks will fall all over themselves about their good fortune...,ontonotes5
Developing US 460 and linking it to a rail and road crossing from the Port of Norfolk is the way to take traffic off I on The Peninsula.,ontonotes5
Larry Gross: You already have rail-coal and Amtrak along old US 60/ I 64 on the Peninsula.,ontonotes5
The idea is rail on the Southside to take the Port of Norfolk containers.,ontonotes5
"I always thought high speed on The Peninsula connecting to Richmond and DC was the ticket ,",ontonotes5
but WHERE are those Port of Norflolk containers headed to?,ontonotes5
... and if it is cheaper to move goods across the company by truck.. then why would we expect moving goods across Virginia to be any cheaper?,ontonotes5
Lost in the hyperbole coming from Hampton Roads about ``tolls'' being the only way to save our so-called ``transportation crisis'' is any factual information about ``tolls''.,ontonotes5
And in fact in Virginia it will cost even more as there is no big bureaucracy in place to administer it.,ontonotes5
The risk being experienced by the Dulles Toll Road folks who have been losing more money than they knew they could lose.,ontonotes5
The i/ Mercury Blvd project that is 77% over budget and almost 3-years behind schedule -LRB- by VDOT's own account -RRB- IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ``On time-On budget'' figure.,ontonotes5
The only crisis in transportation we have in Virginia is a loss of trust and confidence in both VDOT and the Legislature.,ontonotes5
"If you're Arlington County, you create a new vision for the boxy buildings and subterranean passageways in Crystal City that will be emptied by the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission.",ontonotes5
"In place of the sterile monoculture that now characterizes the office complex near the Pentagon, members of an advisory task force see a more lively street-level scene with a greater mix of shops, restaurants and offices.",ontonotes5
-LSB- Board of Supervisors Chairman Chris -RSB- Zimmerman and others speaking yesterday said that the vounty sees the empty space as an opportunity to ``reimagine'' and ``brand'' Crystal City as an attractive destination.,ontonotes5
"Though close to Reagan National Airport and dense with hotels, the area has long been seen as a gloomy 1960s era enclave of offices connected by underground passages.",ontonotes5
"But parts of Crystal City have lately seen a rebirth, thanks to an influx of trendy cafes and a new streetscape....",ontonotes5
It turned Crystal Drive into a two-way main street and has recruited new shops and chic restaurants such as Jaleo and McCormick & Schmick's.,ontonotes5
"As Ed Risse has pointed out, the relocation of 17,000 jobs creates a rare opportunity to create a genuine balanced communities in Northern Virginia.",ontonotes5
"The problem, I surmise--it's not discussed in the story--is that Arlington is concerned about protecting its tax base, which means replacing the vacated offices with new offices, not housing.",ontonotes5
It's hard to fault Arlington for pursuing its short-term self interest.,ontonotes5
"But everyone needs to recognize that Arlington's decision not to pursue a balanced community means that housing will end up somewhere else, presumably in outlying counties.",ontonotes5
And employees working in the buffed up Crystal City will wind up commuting long distances and clogging Northern Virginia thoroughfares.,ontonotes5
"unlike most other Virginia counties, Arlington County does not have a Board of Supervisors.",ontonotes5
"If Arlington has sufficient public infrastructure to support housing at Crystal City, adding housing to that area would be an excellent idea.",ontonotes5
The question that the Arlington community needs to answer is: Whether the supporting infrastructure is sufficient?,ontonotes5
"The funds run one way from Arlington, just as they do from Fairfax--down to Richmond and then around the state.",ontonotes5
"Moreover, while I'm sure that many people would enjoy the urban life of a newly revitalized Crystal City, many others would not.",ontonotes5
"Many people simply want to live in single family, detached homes that will not be available in Crystal City.",ontonotes5
"There probably aren't enough tax dollars--even in the mind of John Chichester--to fix NoVA's transportation and other infrastructure problems that are, in large part, based on the high concentration of good-paying jobs here, along with a lack of both affordable housing.",ontonotes5
Virginia needs balanced job growth.,ontonotes5
"But, what would be the benefit to Arlington to do this?",ontonotes5
More specifically-what would be the benefit to those who already live and pay taxes in Arlington?,ontonotes5
What would Arlington have to provide in the way of additional infrastructure?,ontonotes5
It would seem to be that if you took an office building in Crystal and converted it to apartments.. you 'd not have any more people -LRB- perhaps less -RRB- so you wouldn't need any more water/ sewer capacity... and ditto for parking places... at least it would seem so -RRB-.,ontonotes5
"instead of a hoard of folks ``in commuting'' from outer jurisdictions to Arlington every morning, wouldn't you have instead-more ``out'' commuting.",ontonotes5
It would seem-that Arlington and the other area jurisdictions have already had such a choice for years-and that they chose commercial development over residential-in effect-letting more remote jurisdictions figure out how to provide residential for folks who wanted to work in NoVa and commute to the outer suburbs to live.,ontonotes5
To a certain extent-one could say that No Va jurisdictions have a responsibility to provide housing for those that work in the same area and NOT force workers to commute to outer jursidictions for housing in the first place.,ontonotes5
What kind of an exercise would it be for each NoVa jurisdiction to total up the number of jobs in its boundaries verses the amount of housing within its boundaries.,ontonotes5
"In other words a huge percent of our population are, in fact, NoVa commuters.",ontonotes5
With respect to the jobs/ housing question-I wonder what the totals would be for the entire NoVa area-all jursidictions with respect to jobs verses housing.,ontonotes5
"In some respects, isn't that essentially what No Va jursidictions are doing-favoring non-residential development and letting other jursidictions handle the residential?",ontonotes5
Turning this on its head-what is the incentive for a worker in Crystal City to buy there?,ontonotes5
"but if I bought at Crystal City, I 'd be locked in to that area.",ontonotes5
"What happens if my next job is in Silver Spring, or Leesburg, or Quantico?",ontonotes5
of us would likely support the abolishment of all zoning as is basically the case in Houston.,ontonotes5
What about building a 30-story building in the flight path of Dulles Airport?,ontonotes5
We have a serious problem with public infrastructure in areas of Virginia.,ontonotes5
"Few would likely argue that, because of the high forward-looking costs for constructing infrastructure, we should not permit any building in Virginia without the upfront payment of the total costs for constructing infrastructure.",ontonotes5
"But, at the very same time, isn't equally unfair to load all of the infrastructure costs on taxpayers--especially given Virginia's tax structure that takes much from NoVA and gives little back?",ontonotes5
One might be able to make a good argument that we could save transportation costs by building densely in NoVA.,ontonotes5
But what about the other infrastructure costs that are then imposed on residents of NoVA?,ontonotes5
"It offers some interesting insights and observations, including the following: ``Gerald L. Gordon, president of Fairfax's Economic Development Authority, said jobs will keep moving toward the fringes ,",ontonotes5
People who want to live in New York City tend to move there.,ontonotes5
Why are we talking about spending billions of scarce tax dollars extending Metrorail when it isn't going to fix the transportation problems?,ontonotes5
"BTW, check out the other story in the Post today about Fairfax County Supervisor Gerald Hyland's involvement with a developer's attempt to obtain huge conservation tax credits.",ontonotes5
His previous statement was that while the percet job growth in PW was high the absolute number was small.,ontonotes5
Metro will not ease congestion and it hasn't done so for the last thirty years.,ontonotes5
"Clearly, that does not include billing the tollroad users for Metro construction.",ontonotes5
Making Route 7 sixteen lanes is probably just as bad an idea as Metro.,ontonotes5
"Maryland has proposed selling land to raise money, Fairfax to support affordable housing, and The Vint Hill Economic Development Authority is arguably the largest developer in Fauquier.",ontonotes5
all things being equal.. a newcomer in NoVa needs infrastructure to support them in not very different ways that-that same newcomer in the outer burbs would need similar infrastructure -,ontonotes5

"Reader Rob Jackson calls attention to an article in today's Wall Street Journal about the experiment in Stockholm, Sweden, with congestion pricing.",ontonotes5
"Socialist though they may be, Sweden's politicians apparently have a firmer grasp of economics than Virginia's.",ontonotes5
The Greater Stockholm region has nearly two million people.,ontonotes5
"As the WSJ explains: Before the trial began, Stockholm spent about$ 180 million on improvements to public transportation.",ontonotes5
"So far, the idea of congestion pricing in Virginia hasn't gotten past the talking stage.",ontonotes5
Oh yeah--a system that tracks every car's movements through transponders will go over with the public in Va.,ontonotes5
It strikes me as remarkable that our transportation policies are more socialistic than Sweden's.,ontonotes5
"By all accounts the Stockholm experiment has been a success, so far.",ontonotes5
"First, Stockholm spent$ 180 million on transportation improvements before the experiment.",ontonotes5
"Second, Stockholm had the presence of mind and the fairness of government to put this together as an experiment, and allow the citizens to dismantle it later if they thought it not worthwhile.",ontonotes5
Where is the referendum on whether we should spend umpteen billion on the Tyson's project?,ontonotes5
"Third, granted, the government in Stockholm has every incentive to spin this in a good light ,",ontonotes5
"In London, it took quite some time for the economic effects to sort themselves out and be measured.",ontonotes5
"Although the London experiment also seems to be a success, there is considerable movement against it and the rapid rise in tolling charges that followed.",ontonotes5
In London there seems to be a distinct decrease in business just inside the edge of the congestion zone and a distinct increase just outside.,ontonotes5
"It is too soon to see what happens in Stockholm ,",ontonotes5
but the situation in stockholm is a lot different from London.,ontonotes5
Singapore is another example of effective use of congestion pricing.,ontonotes5
"I'm not usre that there's much about Singapore's governmental philosophy that we should emulate -LRB- thinly disguised one-party rule -RRB- but, as someone who has spent a great deal of time there over the past 20 years, I can testify that traffic in the center city is much improved without any indication that economic development has been curtailed.",ontonotes5
"In Southern California, there are at least two tollways with variable pricing that fluctuates with traffic density.",ontonotes5
So.. think in terms of the entire NoVa area with a connecting network of electronically tolled roads being priced by the hour... and the place much like cell phone minutes.,ontonotes5
"Congestion pricing doesn't seem to have limited Singapore's economic activity, but how would you know?",ontonotes5
This will not end until the Dillon Rule is discarded in Virginia or Northern Virginia forms a separate state.,ontonotes5
If you want to continue the cell phone analogy then Maryland ought to have a chance to propose their approach to traffic management using Northern Virginia's taxes as a competitive alternative to the General Assembly's proposal.,ontonotes5
The people of Northern Virginia -LRB- i.e. the buyers of the product offered under congestion ``pricing'' -RRB- would then have a choice-like they do today with cell phone service.,ontonotes5
"Until there is choice, this is just another method of perpetuating the Northern Virginia subsidy of the southern Virginia welfare state.",ontonotes5
Northern Virginia's gripes over these funding formulas could be shared by the affluent suburbs of the Richmond area --,ontonotes5
but you don't hear Richmond suburbanites fantasizing about seceding from the state.,ontonotes5
-LRB- For the record: I live in Henrico County. -RRB-,ontonotes5
"They're entirely happy with the arrangement that divests it from any responsibility for the ``inner city'' of e Washington, D.C., and all those icky poor people ,",ontonotes5
"In other words, these people advocate cherry picking the most affluent suburban jurisdictions of NoVa, creating a separate political entity for themselves and insulating themselves from the urban and rural poor.",ontonotes5
"I do spend a sizable chunk of my time looking at, reading about and thinking over new art in Los Angeles and elsewhere ,",ontonotes5
"The decade of the 1980s was a pivot, when New York's postwar role as serious art's only serious city came to an end.",ontonotes5
"Take the 2006 California Biennial at the Orange County Museum of Art, opening today.",ontonotes5
"It is typical of most such surveys, which are commonplace in an art scene now sprawling from Berlin to Beijing.",ontonotes5
"There's the show business shtick of the performance troupe My Barbarian, which turns homemade riffs on TV and Broadway into political entertainment.",ontonotes5
"Speaking of buildings, for a current show in Pasadena, Carlos Mollura has inserted polyethylene cubes, spheres and other geometric shapes into architectural orifices at a Colorado Boulevard shopping plaza.",ontonotes5
"At Blum & Poe Gallery at the edge of Culver City, meanwhile, a carved lump of luxurious sandstone by Matt Johnson begins with Michelangelo's Renaissance dictum that sculpture is a spiritually inclined process of chipping away stone to liberate a natural life force already locked inside.",ontonotes5
Katie Grinnan's sculpture at ACME follows an entirely different track.,ontonotes5
And their extreme eclecticism is not exclusive to California.,ontonotes5
The landmark exhibition of Robert Rauschenberg's 1950s hybrids of painting and sculpture that closed recently at the Museum of Contemporary Art convinced me of that.,ontonotes5
"Nowhere has the problem been more keenly felt than in New York, center of not just the art market and art media but traditional museum culture.",ontonotes5
"Contemporary programming at the Guggenheim, the Metropolitan, the Modern and Whitney can most charitably be described as a train wreck.",ontonotes5
"America's political battles of the past 20 years may center on attempts to repeal or defend the dramatic changes wrought during the 1960s, but our robust artistic bounty today is its resplendent legacy.",ontonotes5
Last tango in Paris,ontonotes5
Paris was once the sex capital of the world.,ontonotes5
"Every day of the week, from mid-morning until the early hours, the Club 88 on rue Saint-Denis in central Paris does a brisk trade.",ontonotes5
"From the outside at least, there is little to distinguish it from the dozen or so rival sex shops which line the streets in this part of Paris, in between the stalls flogging cheap hip-hop gear and drugs paraphernalia.",ontonotes5
"the street signs around here give the game away -LRB- la rue de la Grande Truanderie-``the street of great criminality'', named in the 15th century, is still home to evil-looking dope dealers -RRB-.",ontonotes5
The upper end of rue Saint-Denis is lined day and night with prostitutes of all prices and races.,ontonotes5
"As recently as the 1970s, when the vast outdoor market of Les Halles was finally pulled down, it still enjoyed a reputation for gamey, sinful pleasures.",ontonotes5
"Now that Les Halles has been replaced by a shopping mall, this part of the city is avoided by most native Parisians and abandoned to tourists and banlieusards-the kids from the wretched council estates surrounding Paris who come here by a fast, direct train to get wrecked and cause low-level trouble.",ontonotes5
The bleak surroundings make it all the more remarkable that Club 88 and its rival sex megastores have become the latest battlefield in Parisian culture wars.,ontonotes5
"This explains, for example, how Philippe Azoury for the ultra-hip magazine Les Inrockuptibles, evoking the writer and erotomaniac Georges Bataille as his guide, can-without any shred of irony-describe Club 88 as ``probably the best club in the world'' on the grounds that it offers both pleasure and excitement open to all.",ontonotes5
A quick tour around Club 88 reveals the truth of this statement.,ontonotes5
The sex megastore is now a staple feature in the famous red-light districts of Paris -LRB- other big names here include Scarlet and Sexodrome in Pigalle -RRB-.,ontonotes5
"However, despite the DVD viewing cabins, the lifts and escalators, the mumsy female staff and the credit-card friendly ambience which make them feel like a particularly kinky branch of Waterstones, they are not universally popular.",ontonotes5
"This began in the summer of 2002 when Sarkozy, then Minister of the Interior, introduced harsh fines on streetwalkers around rue Saint-Denis.",ontonotes5
The traditionelles of rue Saint-Denis found themselves driven out of the city centre by the harsh laws on street-walking.,ontonotes5
"Many were reduced to working out of vans parked at Porte Dauphine or Vincennes, hoping to pick up trade from passing motorists.",ontonotes5
The newspaper Le Parisien reported angrily on the way on which these native Parisians were being driven out to be replaced by girls from sub-Saharan Africa run by gangs from Kosovo and Romania.,ontonotes5
"The likes of ``Sandrine'', who had worked rue Saint-Denis for nearly 20 years complained in the press that, not only was she being driven to penury, but that the city was losing part of its essential character.",ontonotes5
"She clearly hit a nerve; the likes of Club 88, it was argued by those who took up the traditionnelles ' defence, could be anywhere in Europe, from Barcelona to Hamburg.",ontonotes5
"At stake, it was further argued as the old generation of whores began to leave the city in droves, was the very soul of Paris itself.",ontonotes5
"It is a fact, however, that the history of prostitution in Paris is, for many, inextricably linked to the political fortunes of the city.",ontonotes5
The growth of widespread prostitution in Paris was paralleled by the rise of the new literary genre of pornography.,ontonotes5
"Much early pornography was entirely functional, providing a guide to well-known brothels, such as Le Gros Millan on rue du Beaujolais or Le Grand Balcon on rue de la Croix des Petits-Champs.",ontonotes5
"During the Revolution of 1789, the Palais-Royal, the great colonnaded space then at the heart of the city, played host to nightly sex shows.",ontonotes5
"The erotic life of the city during this period-when the likes of Bataille and his friends and lovers -LRB- the poet Colette Peignot, who was his lover and intellectual muse was an eager participant in these adventures -RRB- could buy a whole orgy at one of the clubs on rue Saint-Denis-was beautifully photographed by Brassai and enhanced Paris's reputation as a city of endless erotic powers.",ontonotes5
"This subterranean sexual city was effectively wiped out by 1946, when the authorities, disgusted by the close relationships between brothel owners and the occupying German forces, shut down more than 180 of the notorious maison closes-the legal brothels scattered throughout the city, but especially clustered around rue Saint-Denis.",ontonotes5
"These establishments, including such famous names as Le Chabanais -LRB- which dated back to 1820 -RRB-, Le Sphinx, Le One Two Two -LRB- this has survived into the 21st century as a swingers ' club -RRB-, were not only a part of Parisian folklore but had stood as elaborate and rich monuments to all forms of human sexual activity.",ontonotes5
"Somewhere such as Le Sphinx or Le One Two Two not only offered the regular forms of coupling that could be bought all over the city, but specialised in ``shows'' and ``spectacles'' constructed to the whim of clients, who dined well in the attached restaurants as a prelude to more carnal pleasures.",ontonotes5
"The debates around the closure of the brothels are still, surprisingly, very much a live issue in Paris.",ontonotes5
"They include the likes of Yves Trentret, the academic and satirical novelist, who deplores the commercialised, ``industrial erotica'' of rue Saint-Denis.",ontonotes5
"``I am of a generation that can just remember the erotic life of Paris as it was ,'' he says when we meet in a mainly Algerian bar, L' Aec en ciel, in the 13th arrondissement, which has a stock of mainly Arab whores, ``But that way of life has gone for ever.",ontonotes5
"Paris was once known throughout the world as the capital of sex, but even if foreigners come now, they do not find what they are looking for.",ontonotes5
"This is also an argument made by the film director and porn actress Ovidie, who came to national prominence in France in 2002 with her book Porno Manifesto, a polemic in defence of porn.",ontonotes5
"I was then writing a book about Paris which, among other things, set out to cover the underground sexuality of the city",ontonotes5
"and, inspired by her call for a return to older Parisian traditions of sexual experience, I went to speak to Ovidie for the first time on a chilly September morning in a cafe near rue Saint-Denis.",ontonotes5
"In those days, Ovidie was tiny, pierced and dressed in black pyjamas like a junior Maoist. She began by quoting the contemporary thinkers Jean Baudrillard, Georges Bataille and Guy Debord, who, all in different ways, made the case for sexual freedom, and cited the popularity of porn in pre-Revolutionary Paris, before explaining her notion that, because it is based on a universal need, in the right hands, ``porn can set you free''.",ontonotes5
Ovidie went on:,ontonotes5
"I met Ovidie again a few weeks back in Neuilly, the posh part of Paris where she now lives-presumably having made a packet from her films with titles like Orgie en Noir and Lilith.",ontonotes5
"``The problem is with Paris itself, and probably France itself ,'' she told me.",ontonotes5
A place like rue Saint-Denis represents everything that has gone wrong -,ontonotes5
It is now just gangsters and girls who are sex slaves from Eastern Europe and Africa.,ontonotes5
"We talked of the vogue for echangisme -LRB-'' swinging'' -RRB- which was in vogue in Paris in the late 1990s and-as famously documented in the memoirs of Catherine Millet and the novels of Michel Houellebecq-is far from being the naff and suburban activity that it is in Great Britain, was briefly the height of Parisian chic.",ontonotes5
The first and clearest sign of this was the changing of street names in the brothel-ridden streets of Saint-Denis and Les Halles.,ontonotes5
"In 1809, rue Tire-Boudin -LRB-'' Sausage-Puller street'' -RRB- became rue Marie-Stuart;",ontonotes5
"rue Trousse-Nonain, or ``Tumble-Nun street'', already disguised in official documents as Tasse-Nonian, became rue Beaubourg;",ontonotes5
"rue de la Pute-y-muse, or ``Idling Tart street'', became Petit-muse, while the scatological collection of rues Merdeuses, Merdelet, Chieurs and Chiards all disappeared from Haussmann's new maps of the rational and hygienic city.",ontonotes5
"Nowadays, one of the last bastions of a uniquely Parisian approach to sex is Le Beverly, the only true porno cinema in the city centre, which, over the past few years, has been regularly preparing to close its doors for the last time.",ontonotes5
"This cinema stands at the top edge of the red-light district of rue Saint-Denis, almost but not quite in the rapidly gentrifying area of Montorgueil St-Denis.",ontonotes5
"Most of the old-style porno cinemas in Paris were swept away in the 1980s, victims of the booming video trade and the regular appearance of hard-core porn on mainstream television.",ontonotes5
Le Beverly somehow struggled through the 1990s.,ontonotes5
"Le Beverly has never been respectable-the atmosphere in the pitch-black salle de spectacle is tense and fervid, with more than a hint of real physical danger.",ontonotes5

"It has been known for some time that various groups, either Palestinians, North African groups, some of Bin Laden's men actively reside in Yemen, so again, I really question the wisdom of that policy.",ontonotes5
"You say that the US was using Djibouti for more or less the same purposes that, for the last year or so, they have been using Yemen, that they knew that there was a much more anti-American atmosphere in Yemen.",ontonotes5
The US has been attempting to support movements for democratization in Yemen and there has been some attempts to buttress the government of Ali Abdullah Saleh and I believe that this is directly tied into that.,ontonotes5

Is that true and if so why is the United States involved with it now?,ontonotes5
"The government of Yemen, led by the current President Ali Abdullah Saleh, did exhibit pro-Iraqi sentiment during the Gulf War.",ontonotes5

"He likes his nation and he tries to fight for the interest of his nation, but early in the Bosnian war, Kostunica did go to the Bosnian-Serb stronghold of Parle and met several times with Vladaven Karadzic, who was later indicted for war crimes.",ontonotes5

"In fact, just weeks after he was elected he showed Washington that he has his own initiatives and some of them might even frighten leaders in our national capital there, so I think you can expect Fox to continue the economic policies that Mexico has been criticized for, that is following the economic lead of the United States, but at the same time he will come up with concrete policies for dealing with immigrants ' rights and other such matters that we have never really seen before.",ontonotes5

"I would assume this being the first Cold War spy case in 40 years in Russia that a certain number of institutions that are being involved, perhaps are being involved for the first time.",ontonotes5
"Well, there are really no precedents here Tony because, as you mentioned, the last trial of an alleged foreign spy, was actually the trial of Gary Powers way back in 1961, and Gary Powers was shot down over Russia, so his guilt was fairly firmly established and ever since then any suspected spies were usually either sort of simply kicked out of the country, expelled, or they were arrested and then swapped for Russian spies arrested in Western countries.",ontonotes5
And one would assume that the effort is also being made to make sure that US-Russian relations aren't seriously affected by this?,ontonotes5
"Yes, because there have been a number of calls in the American Congress, for example, to introduce economic sanctions against Russia for this.",ontonotes5

NPR's Sylvia Pajoli reports from Podgorica.,ontonotes5
With the international community anxiously following the Yugoslav political crisis from the sidelines Kostunica accused the Russian government of indecision and said Washington was indirectly helping Milosevic's cause.,ontonotes5

"It is the last few months of the presidency so the Middle East has gone belly-up for him so like we are all he's got left, so he is kind of coming back and he is clinging and saying, you know,""Please make it work, please "".",ontonotes5
"In a way presidents don't normally pay as much attention to Northern Ireland as Clinton has, so he has actually paid the Irish question probably too much attention for a President, and what that means is that the people involved in the peace process here believe they are more important than they actually are.",ontonotes5

"In the democracies of Europe, legal experts are saying it can't happen here.",ontonotes5
So yes I think there is a lot of bemusement here in Europe about the difficulties that the Americans are having in choosing a President.,ontonotes5
"However, for example, in France the strict machinery of justice is separated from the constitutional court, which is a separate body, but yes there also the members are appointed by the President and therefore there also, the members of the Coseque Constitutionalle are somewhat open to criticism that the decisions are often more motivated by politics than they are by the law.",ontonotes5
"I wonder in terms of this particular case, now this is certainly an extreme case in the United States with an unfathomably close election, How have other democracies dealt with effective ties, I mean could there for instance be one of elections, you know where our type has gone to the courts, What happens to yours?",ontonotes5
"Well, there have been cases in most recent elections in France where the Coseque Constitutionalle having been apprised of doubtful procedures or doubtful ways of counting the votes, have decided either to the election and have it done over again or to in fact change the winner.",ontonotes5
"Hey, it is interesting there also, when we look at the idea of checks and balances in a non-partisan judiciary, in terms of the checks and balances, that actually originated in France.",ontonotes5
"Yes indeed, it was a political idea put forward in the writings of the and another very famous french political observer Alexis de Tocqueville who visited America and wrote an amazingly good book about American democracy, said exactly that, that America seemed to him to be the single country in the world who has managed to apply the separation of powers between the judiciary, the executive, and the legislative in a better way than any other country.",ontonotes5
"So it's quite surprising for us Europeans to see that the Supreme Court would be involved, not really it seems to us in interpreting the law of the land or the constitution of the United States, but more in deciding the merits of a terribly political case.",ontonotes5

"Well, it's Mirco Merianovic who officially still is the Prime Minister of Serbia.",ontonotes5
"We have to keep one thing in mind that Vojislav Kostunica and the pro-democracy elements in Serbia and Yugoslavia have taken over authority on the federal level, but the key leaders of power are on the republican level.",ontonotes5
"Yugoslavia consists of two republics, Serbia and Montenegro and there were no elections for neither the Serbian parliament, nor the presidency, so the Serbian government officially is still in place.",ontonotes5
"The whole structure of power in Serbia and Yugoslavia was based on one man, Milosevic.",ontonotes5
"Well, since, although, officially you got two different parallel governments going on, the reality is that Mr. Kostunica is trying to consolidate his power over Yugoslavia, what other indications are there that he is having trouble doing that?",ontonotes5
"Everybody is impatient, especially here in Belgrade and Serbia.",ontonotes5
"They have indeed threatened Milosevic allies that they are going to bring out the people onto the streets again so that a completely new authority can be established, not just on the federal level, but also on the level of the Republic of Serbia.",ontonotes5
"Let's talk a little bit also about other important policies of the government, of importance to people outside Yugoslavia, and that is Kosovo.",ontonotes5
There has been some news coming out that Yugoslav troops are going to return to Kosovo by the end of the year.,ontonotes5

"We also saw the American diplomat Willie Montgomery who arrived in Belgrade today to set up most probably a meeting between a senior U.S. official James O'brien, who is coming to Belgrade.",ontonotes5

More on that from NBC's Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon with an NBC News exclusive for us.,ontonotes5
"Tom, in a major development senior U.S. officials tell NBC News, Yemen authorities are holding two suspects believed directly involved in the attack on the ``USS Cole'' and that at least one of the suspects is ``key to the operation, and talking his head off.''",ontonotes5
"U.S. officials report the suspect is providing explicit details how the attack was planned for more than a year then executed with deadly precision, how one safe house and the suicide boat used in the attack were acquired months before the attack, that two other suspects, an explosives expert believed to be Iraqi, and another perhaps a Saudi, supervised the operation then left Aden before the bombing.",ontonotes5
"The suspect also claims they got help from low-level Yemen officials in forging documents, obtaining vehicles, and concealing their operation, but there's apparently no evidence the Yemen government itself was involved.",ontonotes5
"Now, despite all of this, sources say the suspect still hasn't named those behind the terrorist operation but with this breakthrough, U.S. officials are increasingly confident they'll soon know who specifically gave the orders to attack the ``Cole.''",ontonotes5

"Al Gore continued to refuse comment on the erecognize torl battle in Florida, leaving it to his point men, William Daley and Warren Christopher to defend the controversial hand recounts now under way.",ontonotes5
This is the procedure called for by Florida law.,ontonotes5
Florida law provides for an opportunity for hand counts to check machine counts.,ontonotes5
"Christopher said the recounts should be completed within a matter of days and at that point, Gore campaign sources contend, Gore will be in the lead in Florida and on track to win the election.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, Governor George Bush spent the day out of public view, behind the gate of his ranch in Texas, while his point man, James Baker appeared on five network talk shows arguing vigorously that the hand recounts are improper and should be stopped.",ontonotes5
"Bush advisers say if they lose that argument in court this week they may appeal, and if they lose Florida, they may ask for recounts in other states, where the filing deadline has not yet passed and where the vote is close, including Iowa and Wisconsin, states that could help them win, even without Florida.",ontonotes5
"There could also be a recount in New Mexico, where the race is a virtual tie.",ontonotes5
"The Gore team is also still considering other options, including going to court if the hand recount does not give them the lead in Florida, so while both sides say they want to move as expeditiously as possible, both are considering strategies that could cause this fight to drag on for weeks.",ontonotes5

"La Guardia's runways can handle a maximum of 75 takeoffs and landings an hour, but between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. each day, airlines schedule 93, a mathematical impossibility, and it stays that way nearly all day long.",ontonotes5
"In and out of La Guardia, it's always delayed, so I always expect to be delayed and to have extra time to blow at the airport.",ontonotes5
"Instead of cutting flights, Congress and the government recently raised the limit at La Guardia, and airlines rushed in, adding 300 more flights a day.",ontonotes5
"At a hearing today, the tempers of New York lawmakers boiled over.",ontonotes5
"Just yesterday, in an admission that adding flights at La Guardia may have been a mistake, the FAA makes a unique attempt to offer some relief--an unusual lottery mixing up the names of airlines in a bowl and drawing to see which of the newest airlines adding flights at La Guardia get to stay and which have to cut back.",ontonotes5

We're just outside of Tampa.,ontonotes5
But he is not a winner yet in Florida.,ontonotes5
There are still several polls that say Bush is still ahead in Florida.,ontonotes5
"Bush's central message on this bus trip across central Florida today was to his diehard supporters telling them go out, tell your friends still on the fence why they need to vote for me, and it's a message the campaign hopes it was able to convey today, because while Florida is a must-win, they also can not ignore the other battleground states.",ontonotes5

"While in Washington today, a potential bombshell.",ontonotes5
"They talked about one individual and one group which we know the name of that was deliberately going to take action against the U.S. and or Israel in Yemen, and a top Pentagon official testifies the warning was actually, , issued only hours before the Cole was bombed.",ontonotes5
"In a separate hearing today, it was revealed a Middle East analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency also warned of impending attacks then resigned in frustration the day after the Cole bombing.",ontonotes5
"The Pentagon tonight says the analyst reports could not have pinpointed the Cole attack, but there's a growing consensus on Capitol Hill that officials here should have seen this disaster coming.",ontonotes5

"Jim Miklaszewski, NBC News, the Pentagon.",ontonotes5
"A crewman Sean Powell back home in Florida said inside the Cole it was chaos, it got dark, we lost power, the ship started to list, that's what scared everybody.",ontonotes5

Yemen is a terrorist hot bed.,ontonotes5
U.S. officials say some members of the President's own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists.,ontonotes5

"Now on the big issue the people thought would be the heart of this race, the notion that Mrs. Clinton was accused of being a carpet bagger, a woman born in Illinois, made much of her professional life in Arkansas and of course has been living in Washington until last year, voters said 52% of them, that that issue did not matter to them at all.",ontonotes5
"This has been a tough race, too, where Rick Lazio, the congressman of eight years from Long Island was accused of being much more tough as a campaigner --",ontonotes5
So that's some of the picture that makes up the results tonight that sent Hillary Rodham Clinton to Washington.,ontonotes5
"And about just how this vote went the way it did tonight in New York, Forrest Sawyer standing by with a look behind the numbers, really.",ontonotes5
New Yorkers know that this was a huge battle over support for Israel and whether the support for Palestine was strong enough.,ontonotes5
"In addition to the scene that you mentioned, the debate, where Lazio invaded her space, as they say, he hit very hard in the last two weeks on issues involved in the Middle East.",ontonotes5

"There are these splits in the country ands with as we increasingly head toward litigation in terms of who the next President of of the United States is going to be, more and more people are becoming more depressed about the process.",ontonotes5
"It gives them a sense of what they have felt for too long now, that politics is just name-callers, increased partisanship, special prosecutors, reliance on lawyers and things that don't affect the ordinary person, that all that has now mushroomed into something called the Presidency of the United States and how we elect a President.",ontonotes5

"Since we're talking about Israeli reel and the Middle East, it's not, you know, the major headline every day, but it certainly was a major story.",ontonotes5
"On the election day, we had hours and hours of broadcast here live, same as in the States, and we've been following this story, of course, every day, but here as usual, I might say, we have news of our own.",ontonotes5
Israel is usually looking up to the President of the United States for some help.,ontonotes5
"Some Israelis at least, if not most of them, are still hoping that President Clinton might be able to intervene and help in the short time he has left, but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in the States, I think more and more Israelis are worried that there's nobody to turn to, and I think what happened in the past few days among Israelis here is a new perception that maybe things in the United States are not as perfect as they might have thought.",ontonotes5

"The overall international environment has not changed, but Taiwan's government has.",ontonotes5
"In June of this year, Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao visited Macedonia and the Vatican, the two countries in Europe that have formal diplomatic relations with the ROC.",ontonotes5
"In August, President Chen Shui-bian traveled to six of Taiwan's diplomatic partners in Central America and Africa.",ontonotes5
"In September, Tien Hung-mao again journeyed to Europe, while Vice President Annette Lu followed up on the president's trip to with a visit of her own to ROC diplomatic partners in Latin America.",ontonotes5
"As is commonly known, Taiwan's diplomatic difficulties mainly are due to the cross-strait confrontation.",ontonotes5
Will the flurry of high-level visits abroad by the new government bring the diplomatic breakthrough that Taiwan's people almost don't dare to hope for?,ontonotes5
Will China adopt a new containment policy?,ontonotes5
What counter-measures does the Taiwan government have?,ontonotes5
"Some say that""national sovereignty""and""economic assistance""are the two""Achilles heels""of Taiwan's foreign relations.",ontonotes5
""" National sovereignty""meets with powerful resistance from mainland China, which resists Taiwan's efforts to establish interstate diplomatic links, a key indicator of sovereignty.",ontonotes5
""" Economic assistance,""on the other hand, though an important tool in maintaining diplomatic ties, has been frequently ridiculed in Taiwan as""checkbook diplomacy. """,ontonotes5
""" National sovereignty""is reflected in a country's ability to engage in diplomatic relations, but in this most critical area for national survival, Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan's international status.",ontonotes5
"Indeed, as Levi C. Ying, an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party, says, mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan's foreign relations.",ontonotes5
"In 1998 the PRC made the boast that by the year 2000 the ROC would have zero diplomatic partners, and moved to undercut Taiwan's relationships.",ontonotes5
"This July, a book published by the PRC entitled Chinese Foreign Policy, the Year 2000, declared that its most important foreign policy goal is to""reunify the country,""and strongly attacked Taiwan's efforts to be admitted to the United Nations.",ontonotes5
"In terms of its relationships with the US and Japan, mainland China makes the""Taiwan problem""a top priority.",ontonotes5
"Liu Pi-jung, a professor of politics at Soochow University, says that in looking at the diplomatic struggle between the ROC and PRC, it is useful to distinguish three arenas: the Asia-Pacific situation, formal diplomatic relations, and international organizations.",ontonotes5
"In terms of the Asia-Pacific situation, the PRC strongly resists any international support for Taiwan, such as the idea of placing Taiwan within the scope of the""Guidelines for US-Japan Defense Cooperation. """,ontonotes5
Thus the attitude of the US has become one of the key factors in cross-strait relations.,ontonotes5
"Since the new DPP administration took office in Taipei, the PRC has been deeply worried by the party's advocacy of Taiwan independence.",ontonotes5
"As a result, the two sides have yet to open any formal dialogue mechanism such as existed before the freezing of cross-strait relations which occurred after former president Lee Teng-hui went to the US in 1996.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, Taiwan's position in the US-PRC-ROC triangle has deteriorated as a result of Lee Teng-hui's""special state-to-state""formula and mainland China's active efforts to improve relations with the US.",ontonotes5
An example of the latter is the September visit of PRC President Jiang Zemin to New York to participate in the United Nations millennial conference.,ontonotes5
"In the run-up to the US presidential election, there has been an effort by anti-Communist forces in the US to""demonize""China, and Jiang's address to the UN-which was very friendly in tone and was delivered in English-is widely believed to have effectively improved the negative image of China in the US.",ontonotes5
"At the end of September, the US Congress passed a resolution granting the PRC permanent normal trade relations, bringing the bilateral relationship another step forward.",ontonotes5
"Jason Hu, formerly foreign minister and now director of the Department of Cultural Affairs in the KMT, warns that the US is already leaning toward the PRC in the trilateral relationship.",ontonotes5
"The PRC has been intensively lobbying the US on the principle of""one China,""and Taiwan can not sit idly by.",ontonotes5
"In fact, the new government in Taipei is aware of this point.",ontonotes5
President Chen has openly asked the United States to play a more active balancing role in the Taiwan Strait.,ontonotes5
"Lee Ying-yuan, a DPP legislator who is tapped to be the next deputy representative of the ROC in Washington, states that at the moment the formal channels between Taiwan and the US are functioning very smoothly, and that Chen's keeping of his promise to make an August stopover in Los Angeles very low-key has strengthened mutual trust between the US and the new government.",ontonotes5
"In addition, Taiwan is trying to strengthen so-called""track two""communications between think tanks in the ROC, PRC, and US.",ontonotes5
"While the PRC is deeply involved in Taiwan's relationship with the US, it has an even more immediate target: to break Taiwan's formal diplomatic relationships, which give Taiwan the status of a sovereign country.",ontonotes5
"For many years now, the number of countries which recognize Taiwan has been between 28 and 30, with the current number being 29.",ontonotes5
"However, recently the PRC has been stepping up its pressure on ROC diplomatic partners in Latin America, Africa, and the South Pacific.",ontonotes5
"The book Chinese Foreign Policy, the Year 2000 specifically states that Beijing is targeting Taiwan's diplomatic partners in Central America-Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic-for upgrading of formal relationships.",ontonotes5
"For example, says the book, last year relations between Beijing and Panama took a giant step forward, indicating that rumors in Taipei about a possible break in relations with Panama were not completely unfounded.",ontonotes5
"Also, when Chen Shui-bian visited the Dominican Republic in August, the ROC ambassador there reported that in 1997, the PRC managed to get the Dominican Republic's agreement to the establishment of a PRC office in the DR capital by playing on the DR's desire to extend its consular rights in Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
"In Africa, last year the PRC tried very hard to get Taiwan's eight diplomatic partners on that continent to participate in the""Sino-African Cooperation Forum""held in Beijing in October.",ontonotes5
"Although ultimately all eight refused, the PRC's determination to strengthen interactions with these eight countries is unmistakable.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, in the South Pacific, there were gains and losses, with the ROC losing its formal ties with Tonga but gaining formal recognition from the Marshall Islands.",ontonotes5
Taiwan does not have many cards to play in developing formal diplomatic relationships.,ontonotes5
"Early on, Taiwan's agricultural technology and the dedication of its agricultural cooperation teams helped maintain relations with African and South Pacific countries.",ontonotes5
"In recent years, Taiwan's economic power-including both financial assistance and overseas investment-has added another card to play.",ontonotes5
"Nevertheless, Taiwan's foreign assistance programs have been a subject of considerable criticism at home.",ontonotes5
""" Although you can argue that it is vital to maintain formal diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible until such time as there is a tacit diplomatic cease-fire with Communist China, today, when Taiwan's budget faces growing constraints and the island has not yet recovered from the recent earthquake, it is not acceptable for the government to be spreading such a huge amount of money abroad. """,ontonotes5
"In the past Taiwan was a recipient of American aid, so now that Taiwan has the economic power to return the favor to the international community, it should do so.",ontonotes5
"Moreover, explains Hu,""In fact the amount of money Taiwan spends on foreign assistance is very limited.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan, on the other hand, is spending only about 0.1%! """,ontonotes5
"Since there is a basic obligation to help all countries in need, and Taiwan is already doing less than it should, it is all the more understandable that Taiwan gives aid to countries with which it has formal diplomatic relations.",ontonotes5
Relations between the ROC and its diplomatic partners should be seen as mutually beneficial.,ontonotes5
"Taiwan's diplomatic partners have economic needs, so we give financial assistance.",ontonotes5
"Chang continues:""It is shallow to see the maintenance of relations between the ROC and its diplomatic partners as depending only on money.",ontonotes5
""" In fact, in recent years the PRC has spent much larger sums of money than Taiwan in trying to woo away the ROC's diplomatic partners.",ontonotes5
"Take for example the so-called""banana diplomacy""the PRC employed toward Costa Rica three years ago.",ontonotes5
"Attempting to take advantage of the fact that bananas are Costa Rica's main export, the PRC, through private channels, indicated that it would be willing to purchase Costa Rican bananas at a high price.",ontonotes5
"However, because the PRC has no formal diplomatic relations with Costa Rica, they would have to add a 40% customs tax.",ontonotes5
"As it turned out, Costa Rican bananas had been contracted out early to large corporations, and also some of the companies commissioned by the PRC failed to pay up as promised, causing Costa Rican farmers to lose confidence in them.",ontonotes5
"As a result, the PRC goal was not achieved.",ontonotes5
"Nonetheless, from this case you can see that PRC diplomacy has been extended to cover the commercial field as well.",ontonotes5
"Learning from this, President Chen says that Taiwan must deepen its economic diplomacy.",ontonotes5
"The problem is that Taiwan has been engaged in economic diplomacy for many years now, yet the results are not particularly obvious.",ontonotes5
"The number of ROC diplomatic partners is far behind that of the PRC, which seriously impedes Taiwan's efforts to take part in international organizations.",ontonotes5
"For international organizations of which the PRC is already member, such as the United Nations, although Taiwan has repeatedly knocked at the door, it has met with repeated failure as a result of international pressure imposed by the PRC under the""one China""principle.",ontonotes5
"As for the World Trade Organi-zation, to which both sides are attempting to gain entry as early as possible, the PRC has brought its diplomatic superiority to bear in order to ensure that it will enter prior to Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"However, because negotiations with the United States on early PRC entry have not reached a successful outcome, PRC entry has been continually postponed, which has seriously affected the schedule for ROC entry.",ontonotes5
How much room to maneuver does Taiwan have in this respect?,ontonotes5
"Lo Chih-cheng, chairman of Research and Planning Board at the MOFA, believes that Taiwan still has room to maneuver in terms of international economic organizations.",ontonotes5
"But as for the UN and its affiliated organizations, such as the World Health Organization or UNESCO, the ROC faces countless obstacles.",ontonotes5
"In fact, the ROC is currently the only nation that enjoys sovereignty that is excluded from United Nations.",ontonotes5
"When Chen Shui-bian visited Costa Rica in August, the president of that country, Miguel Angel Rodriguez, indicated for the first time that his country would be willing to help Taiwan enter the UN.",ontonotes5
But he suggested that Taiwan should reconsider its tactical approach; otherwise repeated failure could cause people to lose interest and faith.,ontonotes5
"In fact, this has already happened in Taiwan's public, which has seen the UN effort fail repeatedly.",ontonotes5
People are wondering whether something should be changed in the ROC approach to the UN.,ontonotes5
""" Applying for entry to the UN demonstrates that Taiwan is a sovereign state and is qualified to be a UN member.",ontonotes5
This reminds the international community to be aware of Taiwan's existence.,ontonotes5
"In addition, from the perspective of the foreign ministry, efforts to re-enter the UN are not only excellent training for diplomatic personnel, but also provide a regular test of how secure relations are between the ROC and its diplomatic partner states,""explains Lo.",ontonotes5
"The PRC worked for 21 years to gain entry to the UN, while we have only been at it a few years.",ontonotes5
This year the ROC application to the UN particularly emphasized that the UN could serve as a forum for the peaceful resolution of the cross-strait problem.,ontonotes5
This increases international understanding of Taiwan's sincerity vis-a-vis the cross-strait and international relations issues.,ontonotes5
"The Research and Planning Board intends to establish a special NGO subcommittee, led by the government, to provide information and practical assistance to domestic NGOs in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Lo explains that in democratic countries, with whom Taiwan would like to strengthen ties, public opinion is the source of policy direction.",ontonotes5
"By emphasizing the government's concern for human rights on the international stage, not only can Taiwan make its own democratization experience available for other countries currently going through the same process, it can bring itself closer to those countries which also place a strong emphasis on human rights.",ontonotes5
"In early September the MOFA announced that, based on efficiency evaluations, the government would close its representative offices in the African countries of the Congo, Angola, and Madagascar.",ontonotes5
"As Lo says,""The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly. """,ontonotes5
"In the future, overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level, with different locations having different specialties, such as overseas Chinese affairs, political affairs, and media relations.",ontonotes5
"Lo says that the main countries that will be at the center of future diplomatic work, besides the ROC's existing diplomatic partners, will be the nations of North America and Europe.",ontonotes5
"Though in office for less than four months, foreign minister Tien Hung-mao has already been to Europe twice.",ontonotes5
"Based on his comments, analysts infer that Taiwan may in the near future establish formal diplomatic relations with another European country.",ontonotes5
"Following closely on President Chen's trip, in late September Vice President Annette Lu traveled to Central American countries that President Chen could not fit into his itinerary, including El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, and Guatemala, all of which have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights, democracy, high-technology, compassion, and peace.",ontonotes5
"If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such""soft power,""one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join.",ontonotes5
But many people say that the root of the ROC's foreign policy difficulties is still in the relationship with the PRC.,ontonotes5
"If more states support Taiwan, Taipei will have more cards to play in cross-strait negotiations, and domestic morale will be bolstered and people's fears alleviated.",ontonotes5
"The global values espoused by Taiwan, including democracy, human rights, love, and peace, are the real assets of ROC diplomacy.",ontonotes5
"Maysing Yang, vice chair of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ' Research and Planning Board, lived for many years in New York.",ontonotes5
"She joined Taiwan's political opposition movement very early in her career, and for a time chaired the Democratic Progressive Party's Foreign Affairs Committee.",ontonotes5
She became the first serving MOFA official to enter the UN headquarters building since the ROC left the UN.,ontonotes5
"When news of this got out, the PRC delegation at the UN immediately pro-tested, and demanded that the two should leave the conference chamber and be excluded from the UN building.",ontonotes5
But their actions also attracted the criticism that this kind of high-decibel display is not in fact helpful for achieving Taiwan's return to the United Nations.,ontonotes5
"Enthusiastic, outspoken and full of vitality, she is highly optimistic about Taiwan's prospects for participation in UN-associated NGOs, and believes that as temples of popular campaigning, NGOs can develop the strength of the Taiwanese people.",ontonotes5
"These are all very important things for Taiwan to be thinking about, so we ought to participate more.",ontonotes5
"For example, a couple of months ago I went to Warsaw to attend the International Forum on Democracy.",ontonotes5
"Those attending included the great American entrepreneur George Soros, who funded the forum, the former US ambassador to Beijing, Winston Lord, and so on-all high-ranking, highly influential people.",ontonotes5
"At present, apart from the World League for Freedom and Democracy, a number of other NGOs in Taiwan are associated with the UN, including women's, aboriginal and academic groups.",ontonotes5
"Another way people in Taiwan can actively participate in international affairs is by encouraging people of ability and influence in society to apply to join the UN's own NGOs, such as population, human rights, peace and environmental groups, so that they can contribute their knowledge, and at the same time let others better understand people from Taiwan.",ontonotes5
The Taiwan issue is one of basic human rights.,ontonotes5
"In other words, the people of Taiwan are being denied the right to speak and vote in international affairs.",ontonotes5
"The administration has allegedly focused especially on KMT party chairman Lien Chan, People's First Party chairman James Soong, DPP chairman Frank Hsieh, and Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou.",ontonotes5
Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou was angered to learn that intelligence organs would abuse their power by carrying out political surveillance against the Taipei City Government.,ontonotes5
"DPP chairman Frank Hsieh also voiced concern, pointing out that when he recently canceled a proposed visit to Xiamen the news media had access to confidential information related to the matter.",ontonotes5
"Instead, said Wang, the MJIB will concentrate on""investigating criminal activities and countering the attempts of individuals -LRB- and organizations -RRB- from mainland China and foreign countries to infiltrate or spy on Taiwan. """,ontonotes5
Taiwan now faces two very pressing tasks related to its intelligence operations.,ontonotes5
Lee Kuan Yew Visits Taiwan,ontonotes5
"Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore came to Taiwan on September 23, and though he did not publicly comment on the purpose of his visit, observers everywhere speculated that he may have come as an intermediary between Taipei and Beijing.",ontonotes5
"Indeed, Lee, who has been dubbed""the Asian Godfather,""played a key role in the early 1990s in bringing about the first round of talks between Taiwan's Koo Chen-fu and Beijing's Wang Daohan.",ontonotes5
"It remains to be seen whether Lee's visit will bring any change in sensitive cross-strait relations, but President Chen Shui-bian revealed after Lee's departure that he and his guest had reached three points of consensus, including the need for a Singapore-Taiwan free-trade zone.",ontonotes5
Lee's four-day series of closed-door meetings in Taiwan came to an end on September 26.,ontonotes5
"He met twice with President Chen Shui-bian and had numerous contacts with a wide range of other leading members of Taiwan society, including Tang Fei -LRB- premier -RRB-, Tsai Ing-wen -LRB- Mainland Affairs Council [ MAC ] chairwoman -RRB-, the three MAC vice chairmen, Shi Huei-yow -LRB- Straits Exchange Foundation [ SEF ] vice chairman -RRB-, Chuang Ming-yao -LRB- National Security Council [ NSC ] secretary-general, Chiou I-jen -LRB- SEF deputy secretary-general -RRB-, Lee Yuan-tseh -LRB- chairman of the Presidential Office's inter-party task force for policy coordination -RRB-, and Nita Ing -LRB- chairwoman of Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corporation -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"As one of the most senior politicians in the Asian region, and a man who has had close ties with several generations of leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Lee Kuan Yew maintains a special status in both Taiwan and mainland China.",ontonotes5
"When asked whether Lee Kuan Yew had come as Beijing's emissary, Chen said,""I can guarantee that he has not. """,ontonotes5
"Tsai Ing-wen, who met twice with Lee during his brief stay, added that Lee has considerable political stature in Asia and around the world, and his concern about cross-strait relations and the direction of policy in this regard is helpful to Taiwan.",ontonotes5
Beijing has also commented favorably on Lee's visit.,ontonotes5
"PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi stated that while the Taiwan issue is China's internal matter, it welcomes efforts by anyone who upholds the""one China""principle to bring about an early resolution.",ontonotes5
"It would thus appear that Lee's visit was welcomed by leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, but in fact the two sides did not actually share a common view on the matter.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan's top concern was peace and stability, while mainland China continually brought up the theme of unification.",ontonotes5
"Although Lee's trip would seem to have been a shot in the arm for the deadlocked cross-strait relationship, it also generated a lot of speculation and ill will because neither Lee nor anyone who met with him was willing to say a word about the content of their discussions, and ROC officials who went to call on Lee at his hotel skulked around in underground walkways and service elevators to avoid journalists.",ontonotes5
"Lee's stay in Taiwan certainly left the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs -LRB- MOFA -RRB- with a bad taste in its mouth, for the MOFA was not involved in the visit in any way, and wasn't even aware in advance that it was in the works.",ontonotes5
"That seemed quite odd, considering that Lee is the founding father of Singapore and is still active as Senior Minister.",ontonotes5
"President Chen broke the silence after Lee left, stating at a function in honor of model public servants that he and Lee Kuan Yew had reached three agreements, namely that Singapore and Taiwan should: -LRB- 1 -RRB- sign a""Singapore-Taiwan Free Trade Zone Agreement ""; -LRB- 2 -RRB- lend impetus to financial cooperation, especially a possible exchange rate agreement; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- effect telecommunication and Internet alliances.",ontonotes5
"President Chen further stated that after Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB-, Taiwan and Singapore, as fellow members of that select group of economic overachievers that journalists have come to dub""the Four Tigers,""should stop viewing each other as competitors and move toward a friendly division of labor.",ontonotes5
It may be that the pursuit of economic and trade relations is the only way to get Taiwan and mainland China onto the path toward a resolution of the cross-strait stalemate.,ontonotes5
"Separate entry into the WTO by Taiwan and mainland China may be the best opportunity for the two sides to settle upon a""no unification, no independence""modus vivendi.",ontonotes5
It seems apparent that mainland China is the only place where Taiwan's traditional industries can survive.,ontonotes5
Even high-tech industries are slowly making their way to the PRC.,ontonotes5
Uncertainty in cross-strait relations will inevitably hurt Taiwan's economy.,ontonotes5
"Lee Kuan Yew describes the debate between""one China""versus""one China as a point for discussion""and other such issues as mere semantics, and says that only history can bring the cross-strait issue to a resolution.",ontonotes5
"In the second half of his memoirs, which were published in Taiwan in September, Lee writes:""Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can reduce friction by building a relationship that is a bit more acceptable to both sides. """,ontonotes5
"We ought to use Lee's visit as an opportunity to take stock of our current situation and further clarify our policy vis-a-vis mainland China, thereby bringing about an improvement in cross-strait relations.",ontonotes5

"Recently the Taipei City Department of Urban Development announced their idea for a""Taipei Citizen's Passport. """,ontonotes5
Who is their idea of a typical Taipei Citizen?,ontonotes5
"This""passport,""with its middle-class and decidedly Western sensibility, is just one example of how Taipei differs from other places in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Not long after Chen Shui-bian ascended to the ROC presidency, the Office of the President began to come into sharp conflict with Taipei City Hall.",ontonotes5
These conflicts have caused Taipei City to become isolated from Taiwan's other cities and counties.,ontonotes5
Is there a north-south divide between Taipei and the other counties and cities?,ontonotes5
"And are the calls of""Taipei first""and of""Taiwan first""mutually reinforcing or mutually exclusive?",ontonotes5
Taipei's wealth and high status as the capital have long been a sore spot with many people living elsewhere in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"Some argue that Taiwan ought to be divided into four counties by the Chuoshui River and the Central Mountain Range, with financial resources being equitably divided to create uniform levels of development in each.",ontonotes5
"Why not instead move the capital to Taichung, they suggest.",ontonotes5
"Since the Taiwan provincial government was largely disbanded two years ago, the 21 counties and cities of Taiwan have been directly under the ROC central government.",ontonotes5
"With the election of Chen Shui-bian, the ROC is now under the control of the Democratic Progressive Party -LRB- DPP -RRB-, as are many of Taiwan's other cities and counties, including Kaohsiung, which like Taipei enjoys special status as a""self-governing municipality. """,ontonotes5
"Whereas the south was Chen's principal source of votes, the blue of the KMT holds sway in Taipei, making the city a thorn in the side of the ruling DPP and threatening its privileged position.",ontonotes5
"Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status, and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality.",ontonotes5
Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei.,ontonotes5
Is Taipei really specially blessed?,ontonotes5
"The Taipei Basin holds 12% of the island's population on only 0.8% of its land, yet it has one-sixth of the nation's high schools, one-third of its universities, and 54% of its cultural activities.",ontonotes5
At least 75% of all medium and large international conferences in Taiwan are held in Taipei.,ontonotes5
More than 90% of multinationals in Taiwan have their headquarters in Taipei.,ontonotes5
"Of the remaining, 10 can be found in the Hsinchu Science Park.",ontonotes5
"Whereas numerous factories are spread throughout central and southern Taiwan, most are just producing for somewhere else.",ontonotes5
"As far as the distribution of government largess is concerned, in 1998 government expenditures in Taipei City ran to about NT$ 176 billion -",ontonotes5
"that's three times more than in Kaohsiung City and more than in Taichung City, Miaoli County, Taichung County, Changhua County, Nantou County and Yunlin County combined.",ontonotes5
"If expenditures were divided evenly among all the residents of Taipei City, each would receive NT$ 68,000, far above the NT$ 42,000 for the residents of Kaohsiung, the NT$ 25,000 for residents of Tainan City or the NT$ 17,000 for the residents of Taipei County.",ontonotes5
"In light of this discrepancy, it's no wonder that the other counties and cities angrily look upon the residents of Taipei as""first-class citizens""who live in the lap of luxury, while taking everyone else for a ride.",ontonotes5
"If you want to see how, you could start with Taipei's Mass Rapid Transit -LRB- MRT -RRB- system, which is the world's most expensive at NT$ 440 billion; the Kuandu Nature Reserve, for which Japanese experts were hired to perform wetlands restoration to the tune of NT$ 14 billion; the West Gate District reconstruction carried out in conjunction with the building of the MRT there, which came to more than NT$ 10 billion; the Mucha Zoo, which has consumed NT$ 30 billion since it was built in the 1970s; or the building of the Taipei Financial Center, which will stand 101 stories high, serve as an Asian landmark, and cost the city as much as NT$ 10 billion.",ontonotes5
"This easy-come, easy-go attitude toward money has long been a characteristic of Taipei.",ontonotes5
"Ever since Liu Mingchuan founded Taipei in the late Qing dynasty, rule over Taiwan has switched from nation to nation.",ontonotes5
"Yet no matter who was in control, Taipei has not been shaken from its position as the island's center of government.",ontonotes5
"Nevertheless,""It has only been ten some years that Taipei has really left the others in the dust,""argues Hsia Chu-joe, a professor at NTU's Graduate Institute of Building and Planning.",ontonotes5
"Hsia points out that although the Governor-General's Residence was located in Taipei during Japanese rule, in the agricultural Taiwan of that period, the Japanese colonial administration was concerned about rice and sugar production over the entire Western Plain and treated all the cities about the same.",ontonotes5
"Moreover, at the end of the Japanese era, Japan began to put even more emphasis on Kaohsiung as a base for its advances into the South Pacific.",ontonotes5
"This gave the impetus for Kaohsiung later developing into an""industrial port city. """,ontonotes5
"When the ROC took over, government power returned to the Governor-General's Residence in Taipei, which became the Presidential Palace.",ontonotes5
"Although Taipei remained the political and economic center, Kaohsiung remained as an important center of heavy industry.",ontonotes5
Export processing zones established in the 1960s in Nantzu and Chienchen attracted people from all over southern Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"In the 1970s, during the era of the Ten Construction Projects, both China Shipbuilding and China Steel chose to locate in Kaohsiung.",ontonotes5
"At one point, the city's port was the busiest in the world, as it sent products""Made in Taiwan""across the seven seas.",ontonotes5
"It thus made a pivotal contribution to Taiwan's""economic miracle. """,ontonotes5
"With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung, the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind, but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with""two heads, one north and one south. """,ontonotes5
And to some degree the provincial government's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan wasn't all that forlorn.,ontonotes5
Taichung and Kaohsiung step out!,ontonotes5
"Well then, when did Taipei really start to pull ahead?",ontonotes5
"Japanese and Western manufacturers left, and even Taiwanese companies began to pull up their stakes and move their factories to Southeast Asia and mainland China.",ontonotes5
"What's more, there was a growing environmental consciousness that led the residents of central and southern Taiwan to start opposing industrial projects.",ontonotes5
"Ten years ago the town of Lukang in Changhua County told Du Pont to look elsewhere, and three years ago Taichung County refused to allow Bayer to build a plant there.",ontonotes5
"As a result, other multinationals planning major investment projects stopped even considering Taiwan. """,ontonotes5
"In fact, what Kaohsiung people want most of all is the ' three direct links ' with mainland China,""says Huang Jung-feng, the director-general of Taipei's Department of Reconstruction, who worked for the Kaohsiung City government for many years.",ontonotes5
""" With regularly scheduled flights, Kaohsiung could turn itself into an international port led by its service industries. """,ontonotes5
"Likewise, Lai Cheng-i, chairman of the Taiwan Province Association of Real Estate Investors, which is headquartered in Central Taiwan, recalls that ten years ago the Taichung city government drew up a new plan for the city that called for straight, broad avenues.",ontonotes5
"Many businesses were privately expecting that the Port of Taichung would be able to establish direct shipping links with the mainland, and were even hoping to attract""red capital""from across the strait.",ontonotes5
They had visions of Taichung establishing important links to the Asia Pacific or even to the global community.,ontonotes5
"Kaohsiung and Taichung have excellent ports, but they are like besieged cities with nowhere to go.",ontonotes5
Three years ago the Tuntex Building was completed in Kaohsiung.,ontonotes5
At 81 stories it is one of the tallest skyscrapers in Asia.,ontonotes5
Yet a series of rumors circling about its precarious financial status have turned it into a symbol of Kaohsiung's falling fortunes.,ontonotes5
"While southern and central Taiwan have fallen on hard times, Taipei City has taken full advantage of the 1990s trend toward globalized production.",ontonotes5
""" There is first of all Taipei's position of importance both for the economy and for government, and the thriving science park in Hsinchu,""explains Hsia Chu-chiu, who is a professor of architecture and urban planning at NTU.",ontonotes5

"Taipei, however, plays a pivotal role in the middle, linking all the parts together.",ontonotes5
""" If you eat somewhere like the Agora Garden Conference Center, you'll hear people all around you saying things like, ' Have you been abroad recently? ' or ' I've just come back from overseas, '""says Yang Ting-yuan, the former general manager of Winbond Electronic's semiconductor subsidiary.",ontonotes5
The outstanding performance of Northern Taiwan's high-tech corridor is driving the Taiwan economy and widening the gap between north and south.,ontonotes5
Any such attempt will hinge upon the central government working to redistribute wealth-to take from rich Taipei and give to its poor country cousins.,ontonotes5
"Although redirecting some of the billions appropriated for Taipei City would do little to fundamentally change the economic disparity, many experts believe that it would at least serve as a comforting gesture to the various counties and cities crying for help.",ontonotes5
"Otherwise, if the""southern science park""that is now being built in Tainan County is successful, perhaps it, in combination with the""three direct links""and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan.",ontonotes5
Knowing New York better than Hualien,ontonotes5
Taipei's character is much different than those of other Taiwanese cities.,ontonotes5
""" In attitude, Taipei is like a different country from central and southern Taiwan,""observes Chen Tung-sheng, chairman of NTU's sociology department, and a member of the Democratic Progressive Party's brain trust.",ontonotes5
"First of all, while most counties and cities regard the central government as the boss and Taipei as the imaginary enemy, only Taipei has an""international outlook. """,ontonotes5
"Chen points out that every year more than 900,000 residents of Taipei-or more than 30% of its population-travel overseas.",ontonotes5
Hsinchu comes in second at 28%.,ontonotes5
"By way of comparison, only 6% of Tainan residents and 5.4% of Kaohsiung residents go abroad every year.",ontonotes5
But the Chens are just another middle-class yuppie family in Taipei.,ontonotes5
""" Taipei youth may well know more about the latest fashions in Tokyo and New York than about Yunlin or Hualien,""notes Chen.",ontonotes5
You can see one example after another of how Taipei has its eyes on the world and fingers on the global pulse.,ontonotes5
"At the beginning of September, the Taipei City government broke new ground by sponsoring a gay pride festival.",ontonotes5
"It even invited Michael Bronski, a leader of the gay pride movement in the United States.",ontonotes5
"The event was fiercely opposed by the Presbyterian church and other groups in Taiwan, but it clearly earned points with foreigners who participated enthusiastically and saw it as an embrace of tolerance and diversity.",ontonotes5
""" The fact is that Taiwan puts a lot of effort every year into providing foreign assistance and sending the head of state overseas, but we forget that we engage in foreign relations with our everyday actions,""says Cheng Tsun-chi, who is director of Taipei's Bureau of Labor Affairs.",ontonotes5
"More than 30,000 foreign workers, mostly Filipino or Indonesian nannies and nurses, live in Taipei.",ontonotes5
"If these 10,000 people dislike Taiwan, their opinions will get passed around by word of mouth when they return home.",ontonotes5
"What hope will there then be for Taiwan's foreign relations? """,ontonotes5
"Says Cheng:""Guests from afar should be treated with respect-not only to show that Taipei is serious about becoming an international city, but also because these visitors are one of the links Taipei has to other international cities. """,ontonotes5
""" Taipei is under a lot of pressure because it faces international competition,""says William Chen, the head of Taipei's Bureau of Urban Development.",ontonotes5
"Last December the English-language magazine Asia Week made a list of Asian cities that put Taipei and Osaka in a tie for second place among the most livable cities in Asia, behind only Fukuoka.",ontonotes5
Taipei was up three places from the year before.,ontonotes5
"Nevertheless, since the chart changes year to year, Taipei could slip in the future if it isn't careful.",ontonotes5
""" Taipei is struggling to catch up with Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong, and it has cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Bangkok running fast on its heels,""says Chen.",ontonotes5
"Chen points out that with the PRC lavishing resources on Shanghai, the city was able to complete its highway and put its electric cables underground in just two years.",ontonotes5
""" In terms of quality and diversity, Taipei is ahead, but it's a step behind when it comes to bringing out the pickaxes for an infrastructure project,""Chen admits.",ontonotes5
"For instance, there has long been talk about installing a proper sewage treatment system in Taipei, but currently only 43% of Taipei homes are connected to it.",ontonotes5
"The sewage from most Taipei homes pours out, untreated, into rivers.",ontonotes5
"The residents of Taipei regard themselves as citizens of the""global village,""and are confident in facing international challenges.",ontonotes5
"As a result, they find it hard to accept the current government's""Taiwan-first""orientation and its focus on the""native soil. """,ontonotes5
"The ROC government insists on casting aside the Hanyu Pinyin system that has been used on the mainland and around the world for many years and instead adopting the Tongyong Pinyin system, which has been specially created by a Taiwanese scholar.",ontonotes5
"With its international orientation, Taipei also has a much different attitude than other counties and cities, especially southern ones, when it comes to the issue of independence versus reunification.",ontonotes5
""" Over 30% of Taipei's population is made up of mainlanders [ those who fled the Chinese Communists, and their descendants ],""explains Chen Tung-sheng.",ontonotes5
"Likewise, the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei.",ontonotes5
"What's more, a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place outside of their traditional bases in the countryside, and the city also has a large community of aborigines.",ontonotes5
"With this population structure, the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei.",ontonotes5
"Oddly, as Taipei has gone out of its way to establish ties with the international community and trade with mainland China, it has, whether by intention or not, created distance between itself and the rest of Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Chen Tung-sheng, who grew up in Shalu, Taichung County and has a strong Taiwanese consciousness, remarks that you simply can't get by without speaking Taiwanese south of the Chuoshui River.",ontonotes5
"Only in Taipei do people dare to""eat Taiwanese, but not speak Taiwanese. """,ontonotes5
"To take the simplest example, current ROC president Chen Shui-bian had an outstanding record as mayor of Taipei.",ontonotes5
"In the eyes of the other counties and cities, Taipei may stand alone, but Taipei people themselves struggle with their sense of identity.",ontonotes5
""" Taipei is a classic immigrant city, whose citizens form a ' motley crew, '""says Tseng Shu-cheng, head of the Urban Reconstruction Organization and an associate professor of architecture at Tamkang University.",ontonotes5
"In a survey he conducted several years ago, Tseng found that only one in five Taipei residents were born there.",ontonotes5
""" Ask somebody in Taipei where they are from, and seven out of ten will say they are mainlanders or are from Tainan, Pingtung, Penghu or wherever.",ontonotes5
"He is currently promoting a community development plan in the hope that neighborhoods full of strangers can pull together, and people living in Taipei can begin to regard it as their""new hometown. """,ontonotes5
"But does Tseng himself consider Taipei to be his""new hometown ""?",ontonotes5
"Tseng, who strongly identifies with Tainan County as the place where he grew up, goes back every month to visit his parents.",ontonotes5
But can Tainan provide him with career opportunities?,ontonotes5
"He has seen a syndrome play out there: people's parents die, and then they sell their farmland, let their family home go to ruin, pull up their stakes and move to Taipei.",ontonotes5
""" While many cities and counties want to rediscover their old sense of self, Taipei wants to invent a self-identity that it never had,""explains Tseng, getting at the crux of the difference.",ontonotes5
"And so, at the beginning of the year before last, Taipei City began instituting a system of""community planning masters. """,ontonotes5
"The goal is to get the citizens involved, so that they can help create a Taipei that they feel belongs to them.",ontonotes5
""" Over the past two years, we have discovered that Taipei City is not nearly as cold and lonely as we had once imagined,""says William Chen with excitement.",ontonotes5
"The high quality of people in Taipei has startled Chen, who worked for a long time in the provincial government.",ontonotes5
The people of Taipei can be proud of their high level of education and earnings and their discipline.,ontonotes5
Even Taipei residents themselves were surprised at their ability to accept such high standards.,ontonotes5
"Starting in July of this year, most Taipei residents, who identify themselves as being environmentally conscious, have complied and now separate their garbage.",ontonotes5
""" Although Taipei City has excellent financial resources and special qualities, please don't exaggerate these differences,""cautions Ou Chin-te, the assistant mayor for government services.",ontonotes5
The element of the Taiwan experience that is most worthy of the nation's pride is the relatively even distribution of wealth and resources.,ontonotes5
"While Taipei has National Taiwan University and National Chengchi University, distant Nantou has National Chi Nan University and Chiayi has Chung Cheng University, both of which also have first-rate faculties and curriculums.",ontonotes5
"What's more,""Though people in Ilan and Hualien may earn less money and have fewer facilities and less variety of activities, they also enjoy a lower cost of living, a more relaxed pace of life and clean air,""notes Ou.",ontonotes5
"Compared to many developing countries, where one city often stands far above the others, Taipei's advantages are really not that remarkable.",ontonotes5
Tseng Shu-cheng notes that the areas close to the train stations in Shanghai and Guangzhou are thronged with illiterates looking for work and that beggars can be found on virtually any street in Jakarta.,ontonotes5
"Even in Japan, an advanced industrial nation, Tokyo is 4.6 times as large as Osaka, the next biggest city.",ontonotes5
"The people of Taipei are not unaware of their advantages and distance from the""native soil. """,ontonotes5
"When Lung Ying-tai took over as head of Taipei's Cultural Affairs Bureau, her first move was to invite other local culture officials to a meeting.",ontonotes5
Lung says that Taipei very much wants to share its resources and experiences with other cities and counties.,ontonotes5
"Next year, Taipei wants to hold an""Asian City Cultural Summit. """,ontonotes5
Already 21 counties and cities in Taiwan have signed on as co-sponsors.,ontonotes5
"The""Taipei experience""can be used beneficially.",ontonotes5
"Yet the long-standing differences between Taipei and other localities, as well as the differences in ruling parties, get in the way.",ontonotes5
Seven southern counties and cities have formed a political league centered around Kaohsiung.,ontonotes5
"Taipei, on the other hand, can't even get along with Taipei County, which completely surrounds it.",ontonotes5
Ou Chin-te admits that Taipei has hardly any high-level ties to other cities and counties.,ontonotes5
"This is Taipei's pain, for sure.",ontonotes5
But is it not also Taiwan's loss?,ontonotes5
"The art market in Taiwan has tended to focus on oil painting and ink-and-wash, with relatively little interest in sculpture, photography, ceramics and multimedia.",ontonotes5
"As a result, artists from Taiwan and abroad have been scrabbling for a slice of the public art pie.",ontonotes5
"In Taipei, 1997 was designated as the Year of Public Art, and the following year experimental installations went on display at nine cultural centers around the island, chosen by the Council for Cultural Affairs -LRB- CCA -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"The development of a number of major infrastructure projects, including the Taipei MRT system, the Second Northern Freeway and the new terminal at CKS Airport, released millions-even hundreds of millions-of NT dollars for spending on public art, creating a golden opportunity for eager artists.",ontonotes5
"But the budget for yet-to-be-installed works is even more staggering: NT$ 100 million for public art at the new CKS Airport terminal alone, NT$ 85 million for spending by the Kaohsiung port authority, and NT$ 80 million for stations along the Wanhua-Panchiao branch of Taipei's MRT network.",ontonotes5
"The fact that the contest for nine works to be placed along Taipei's""Tunhwa Art Corridor,""organized by Taipei's Urban Development Department, drew entries from over 130 artists, shows how intense the competition can be.",ontonotes5
Transparency and professionalism in the public art selection process should be beneficial to the overall art environment in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"When the Internet started to take off in Taiwan in 1995, Inforian was one of the first Taiwan Internet startups.",ontonotes5
"Back when the Internet in Taiwan mainly meant college students posting on bulletin boards and fooling around with Mosaic, a 23-year-old graduate student at National Chengchi University named Heidi Hsueh and a graduate student at National Taiwan University named Lawrence Ho decided to form an Internet company together.",ontonotes5
"In the early period, Inforian-or pAsia as it is known today-made money by publishing books and by localizing software for the Taiwan market.",ontonotes5

"When Marco Polo visited the East in the 13th century, if he had not left a written account of his travels, it would have been a virtually wasted trip.",ontonotes5
The recent enthusiasm for the Taipei exhibition of terracotta warriors from Xi'an is due to the fact that these long-buried figures contain information about mysteries dating back 2000 years.,ontonotes5
The dramatic rise and fall of US software stocks this past year reflects the difficulty of assessing the value of knowledge.,ontonotes5
What about Taiwan?,ontonotes5
What advantages does Taiwan have for playing a larger role in this realm?,ontonotes5
"Taiwan currently ranks fourth in the world in value of IT production, and, if you include the plants established by Taiwan investors across the globe, Taiwanese-controlled firms lead the world in manufacturing of IT hardware.",ontonotes5
"In other words, Taiwan has a solid manufacturing base and a large pool of high quality human resources on which it can rely to develop the knowledge-based economy.",ontonotes5
"Also, Taiwan has a strong education system.",ontonotes5
The results of a recent international survey measuring the performance of junior high school students in natural sciences and math show that Taiwan kids finished first in the former and third -LRB- behind only Singapore and Korea -RRB- in the latter.,ontonotes5
This is where Taiwan is at an advantage.,ontonotes5
"However, though Taiwan has its strong points, there are also a number of problems and shortcomings.",ontonotes5
"What kind of knowledge-based economy is Taiwan most suited to? """,ontonotes5
"Wu says that right now what the government is focusing on and what stock market players most hope for is a US-style""new economy. """,ontonotes5
But can the American model be reproduced in Taiwan?,ontonotes5
"The new economy in the US depends heavily, for one thing, on a deep foundation of basic scientific research, which comes up with revolutionary products like genetically modified foods.",ontonotes5
"Another key factor is that the US has a mechanism for innovation and entrepreneurship, so that new ideas have a chance to be brought into play.",ontonotes5
The rapid growth in the new economy has driven a decade-long economic boom in the States.,ontonotes5
"Pearl Tan, public relations manager at Applied Materials Taiwan, a subsidiary of the giant US semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name, points to a prime example: DRAM, the hottest industry in Taiwan, which was a monopoly of the US firm Texas Instruments.",ontonotes5
"Tan notes that although DRAM factories are closing one after another in the US, patent royalties must still be paid to Texas Instruments for each and every one of the more than 100 million DRAMs produced around the world annually.",ontonotes5
"The new economy is a weapon by which the US dominates the world, with""the export of knowledge""replacing the export of goods.",ontonotes5
"Yet, in the entire world, only the US, Japan, and the UK export more technology than they import.",ontonotes5
"Of these three, US income from selling technology is four times the amount it spends buying technology elsewhere, and it earns enough each year in patent royalties to balance its enormous deficit in manufactured goods.",ontonotes5
"In contrast, Taiwan is still showing a nasty deficit in knowledge trade, with money going out twice as fast as it is coming in.",ontonotes5
"The impressive American model would certainly be difficult to apply to the small""shallow""economy in Taiwan.",ontonotes5

"In 1999, total expenditures on R&D in Taiwan by both the government and private sector were a mere NT$ 200 billion -LRB- about US$ 6 billion -RRB-, less than was spent by IBM alone.",ontonotes5
"In contrast to the""picking stars from the sky""US model, says Wu Se-hwa,""the European knowledge-based economy concept is closer to what Taiwan needs. """,ontonotes5

"In recent years, as Taiwan firms have increasingly invested abroad, the""Taiwan experience""has penetrated deeply into Southeast Asia and mainland China.",ontonotes5
"In both the manufacturing and service sectors, Taiwan businessmen have proven adept at flexibly adapting to local society.",ontonotes5

""" Taiwan companies don't understand how to ensure their earnings from management knowledge and company name recognition, and are not in the habit of selling rights or earning royalties,""says Wu with regret, as he offers the following examples: Taiwan department stores are a cut above PRC state-run stores, Taiwan's construction industry has the knack for systematic management, and even industries like eel-raising have their own technologies and operating methods, but people only think about keeping these secrets to themselves and making money by working on their own.",ontonotes5
"Wu suggests that organizations in Taiwan which are dedicated to teaching management methods, such as the China Productivity Center, should assist companies in systematizing and selling the rights to their mangement and operating philosophies, so that the uniquely flexible Taiwan approach to business can be reproduced and marketed worldwide.",ontonotes5
"Looking to the future, the road to a knowledge-based economy is long, but it is the only choice for Taiwan.",ontonotes5

"The terracotta warriors from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, which is included on the list of World Heritage sites of the UNESCO, have come ashore in Taiwan!",ontonotes5
The 17 warriors now on display at the National Museum of History represent the largest contingent from the ancient tomb ever to travel on loan outside of mainland China.,ontonotes5
"Although the warriors may not be aware of it, they are the star attraction at a blockbuster exhibit showing now at the National Museum of History in Taipei.",ontonotes5

"Many schools in central and southern Taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to Taipei, and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look.",ontonotes5
Shaanxi Province was hit by a long drought in the summer of 1974.,ontonotes5
"It also shows how technologically advanced China already was when Qin Shi Huang was buried some 2,200 years ago.",ontonotes5
"In order to create the feel of an actual descent into the emperor's tomb, the museum has arranged the exhibit so that visitors enter on the second floor and descend from there into a tomb-like atmosphere on the first floor, where the dimly lit space affords a glimpse of what was on the emperor's mind during the years he was busily uniting China for the very first time in history.",ontonotes5
Qin Shi Huang united China in the year 221 B.C.,ontonotes5
"The 8,000 figures that have been unearthed at the site in Shaanxi Province were all executed with painstaking realism.",ontonotes5
"In Taipei for the exhibit, Wu explains that some say it is natural that the figures should be taller since people from China's northwest-where the Qin kingdom was located-have always been taller than other Chinese.",ontonotes5
The exhibit will remain in Taiwan until March 11.,ontonotes5
"A terracotta army was crafted to escort Qin Shi Huang, first emperor of a unified China, in the afterlife, where he hoped to live forever.",ontonotes5

The winner of the prize for fine art in last year's National Culture and Arts Foundation Awards-one of the highest honors for an artist in Taiwan-was contemporary painter Hsia Yang.,ontonotes5
"Hsia first became a leading light on the Taiwan art scene back in the 1950s, as one of the""Eight Great Outlaws""who launched the island's modern art movement.",ontonotes5
"Since then his artistic vocation has taken him around the world, and he has at last ended up back in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"What is it that distinguishes Hsia's work and that marked him out for the National Arts and Culture award, and what kind of contribution has he made to contemporary art in Taiwan?",ontonotes5
"Hsia Tzu-hsiang, as he was then named, was born into a literary family in Hunan Province.",ontonotes5
"His grandmother took him to Sichuan to escape the war, and they returned a couple of years later to find the family home in ruins.",ontonotes5
"They wanted to send him to join his elder brother in Changsha, but his brother didn't have the means to take care of him either.",ontonotes5
"Hsia joined up in the year that the Nationalist forces retreated from the mainland, and soon found himself in a desk job at Air Force General HQ in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"The two became firm friends and began to take classes under Li Chung-sheng, the doyen of modern art in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"At Li's Antung Street Studio they teamed up with a group of like-minded young painters, including Ouyang Wen-yuan, Huo Kang, Hsiao Chin, Li Yuan-chia, Chen Tao-ming and Hsiao Ming-hsien.",ontonotes5
"The only choice was the Antung Street Studio, where the monthly fee was just 20 yuan.",ontonotes5
"In 1955, against the advice of their teacher and clueless about the risks involved in starting up a new organization -LRB- Taiwan was under martial law at the time -RRB-, the young artists formed themselves into the Ton-Fan Group.",ontonotes5
"People flocked to buy tickets for the exhibition that they mounted at a venue in Taipei's Chunghua Road, but many visitors found that the art was not to their liking.",ontonotes5
"Only through the introduction of modern forms of expression from the outside world, they said, could the boundless resources of China's art tradition be revitalized.",ontonotes5
"This insistence on the""China""element has been a hallmark of Hsia Yang's art ever since.",ontonotes5
"In 1955 Hsiao Chin went to study in Spain, becoming the first of the Ton-Fan Group to go overseas.",ontonotes5
"He wrote back to Taiwan describing the new trends in art that he was witness to, and the other painters, after poring over the contents of his densely written airmail letters, began putting some of those ideas into practice.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan was very cut off from the world in those days, and those studying art naturally wanted to see for themselves what was happening elsewhere.",ontonotes5
"One by one, each member of the group set off on his own modern art pilgrimage to the West.",ontonotes5
"Hsia Yang, for whom France was the art center of the world, made his move in 1963, traveling by ship from Keelung to Hong Kong and from there on to Europe.",ontonotes5
On the way to France Hsia stopped off in Milan to visit Hsiao Chin.,ontonotes5
During his four-and-a-half years in Paris Hsia lived in a tiny garret in the red light district with barely enough room to stand up in.,ontonotes5
"While he was in France Hsia received a letter from a friend in the US saying:""Life is easier here. """,ontonotes5
"Soon afterwards he moved to New York, renting a cheap loft in SoHo and supporting himself as a furniture restorer.",ontonotes5
"He began employing photographic effects, for example depicting a crowd of passersby on a New York street as a speeding blur.",ontonotes5
"Hsia spent over 20 years in New York, painting in the cavernous gloom of his loft, eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music.",ontonotes5
""" I was like a Chinese person dwelling in a Chinese concession in New York,""says Hsia with a laugh.",ontonotes5
The biggest boon of living in New York was that this was where Hsia met his wife Wu Shuang-hsi.,ontonotes5
"Hsia returned to Taiwan in 1992, after three decades away.",ontonotes5
"With a basic source of income guaranteed through an art-gallery contract, Hsia rented a spacious, light-filled three-story house in Peitou.",ontonotes5
"Luckily Professor Li Chih-wen of the National Institute of the Arts offered to support them to the tune of NT$ 10,000 per month for the first three years after their return to Taiwan, and Hsia and his wife were thus able to settle themselves down.",ontonotes5
"Financial help from his friends at such moments was what enabled Hsia to go abroad in the first place and then, eventually, to return again to Taiwan.",ontonotes5
After returning to Taiwan Hsia Yang reverted to painting fuzzy people.,ontonotes5
"In New York he once made a hand-operated washing machine from a saucepan and several pieces of wood, and on another occasion he used the motor from an electric fan to power a self-adjusting easel.",ontonotes5
""" I'm the Leonardo da Vinci of the Orient,""chuckles Hsia.",ontonotes5
"Returning East has brought Hsia back into contact with the other""Outlaws""who used to dominate the Taiwan art scene.",ontonotes5
"Of those, Chen Tao-ming has since given up art and gone into business, Li Yuan-chia passed away in Britain, and Ouyang Wen-yuan doesn't paint any more because of psychological problems.",ontonotes5
"This""da Vinci of the East""is an expert furniture restorer and is also skilled at giving discarded objects a new life.",ontonotes5
"This sheet of paper carries an inventory of all the pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters in Hsia Yang's possession in 1979, when he was in New York.",ontonotes5
"After returning to Taiwan, Hsia Yang began to do fuzzy-people renditions of figures from the Chinese Buddhist pantheon.",ontonotes5

"The prospect of emigrating to Shang-hai has caught the imagination of middle-class Taiwanese in recent years, and waves of business persons have been pouring into Shanghai since the early 1990s.",ontonotes5
What happens when a Taiwanese expatriate settles in Shanghai?,ontonotes5
"Taiwanese businessman Chen Pin, who moved to Shanghai a decade ago, has written of his experiences in Emigrating to Shanghai, which has sold like hotcakes since it was published just last October by Shang Hsun Cultural Publishing Company.",ontonotes5
"When you think of Shanghai, what comes to mind?",ontonotes5
The grand promenade and European-style buildings along the Bund?,ontonotes5
Chen Pin opened his first business in Shanghai over ten years ago.,ontonotes5
"His son is treated as a PRC citizen, and attends university in Shanghai.",ontonotes5
"Property in Shanghai is divided into various categories, and Chen explains various terms used in the PRC.",ontonotes5
"Buildings sold on the domestic market to PRC firms are called shang pin fang, or literally,""commercial buildings. """,ontonotes5
"Newly arrived Taiwanese business persons often make bad judgments if they plunge into the market without studying it carefully first, so Chen suggests the following rules of thumb: The Shanghai property market is in a slump, so there is no need to rush into a purchase.",ontonotes5
One must not estimate potential earnings on the basis of experience in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"When hard-charging Taiwanese businessmen meet up with their smooth-talking Shanghai counterparts, the Taiwanese often come away with the short end of the stick.",ontonotes5
"From the vendors at open-air markets hawking crabs or pears, to the proprietors of five-star clubs that target a foreign clientele, everyone in Shanghai looks at Taiwanese business persons the same way:",ontonotes5
"Taiwanese men tend to fall like a ton of bricks for the pretty, sweet-talking women in Shanghai, and that signals the beginning of all sorts of problems.",ontonotes5
"Single men practically shout it out:""My girlfriend is in Shanghai. """,ontonotes5
"Those who already have wives in Taiwan will tell you in a low whisper:""I've got a mistress in Shanghai, and I'm taking care of all her expenses. """,ontonotes5
"The women of Shanghai are well known for their liberated ways, and it is no simple matter for Taiwanese men there to handle their business and emotional affairs wisely.",ontonotes5
"Chen argues that allowing direct travel between Taiwan and the mainland would make it much more difficult for Taiwanese men to keep mistresses in the mainland, and would go a long way toward clearing up all the cross-strait marital and romantic problems that now occur so often.",ontonotes5
"Chen offers several pieces of advice for all who would head for Shanghai, whether alone or with their families.",ontonotes5
"Get to know the daily lives of people in Shanghai. """,ontonotes5
""" You must understand that undercurrents in Shanghai are strong.",ontonotes5
You're not in Taiwan anymore,ontonotes5
"In both emotional and historical terms, Shanghai seems very near, but in fact it is a very unfamiliar place.",ontonotes5
"Although the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait share a common language and ethnicity, our long separation has given rise to sharply divergent values and ways of thinking.",ontonotes5
"When someone from Shanghai says,""This isn't a big problem,""you have to realize that he has just acknowledged that there's a problem, and it's up to you to figure out how serious it really is.",ontonotes5
Taiwanese ways don't fly in Shanghai.,ontonotes5

The largest human resources company in Taiwan is the 104 Job Bank.,ontonotes5
"The firm's name comes from the Taiwan number for directory assistance, and suggests that""To look for a job should be as easy as getting a phone number from the operator. """,ontonotes5
"The attraction for similar magazines in Taiwan is being helped along by the current fad for things Japanese, and also by changes in how publications are being sold, with convenience stores getting publications on to the shelves much faster than traditional bookstores ever could.",ontonotes5
"In Japan, where the""bubble economy""phenomenon has been the worst, there are hundreds of human resources firms competing.",ontonotes5
"The two largest media groups in Taiwan, whose flagship papers are United Daily News and the China Times, began invading the human resources market two years ago, and existing job banks went on a binge of mergers.",ontonotes5
"The Southeast Asia Group, which had previously specialized in bringing foreign labor to Taiwan, founded the 1111 Manpower Bank last year, focusing on five main markets: education, civil service, finance, technology, and part-time work for students.",ontonotes5
Looking to Greater China,ontonotes5
"Moreover, all these firms are turning their eyes toward the Greater China market.",ontonotes5
"The 104 Job Bank has been operating beyond Taiwan for some time, having registered its trademark and set up a website in the PRC two years ago -LRB- though it uses 115 in the mainland since that is the number of directory assistance there -RRB-.",ontonotes5
HRGini's Janet Chen says that there is a huge potential client base in the US and the Asia-Pacific region for tech-savvy staff.,ontonotes5
"And Johnson Lee notes:""If Taiwan can become the main axis of human resources management in the Greater China region, not only will this industry not be adversely affected by Taiwan's economic downturn, it will also not be hurt by the large-scale move by Taiwan companies to the PRC. """,ontonotes5
Yet Chinese/ Asian values have been much extolled in the West in the past few years.,ontonotes5
"It was former Singapore premier Lee Kuan Yew who first raised the banner of""Asian Values. """,ontonotes5
"In 1992 Lee said in an interview:""For East Asian countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, group values and behavior have been extremely helpful in the process of ' catching up ' economically.",ontonotes5
"At the United Nations World Human Rights Convention, China's delegate responded to the West's frequent criticisms of China's human rights record in the following terms:""The concept of human rights is a legacy of historical development, and is connected with a country's specific social and economic situation, as well as its history, culture and values.",ontonotes5
"From the viewpoint of East Asian societies, the West tends to over-emphasize freedom and individual rights, and this leads to serious problems.",ontonotes5
"But from the modern perspective, the traditional values of East Asia are even less palatable.",ontonotes5
"In the traditional feudal society of China, the head of the family exercised unquestioned authority.",ontonotes5
"Neighboring places heavily influenced by""Asian values,""such as Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, have a strong sense of how important it is to belong to""the educated class,""just as we do here.",ontonotes5
"The importance that parents attach to education is of course a strong point for Taiwan, but one drawback of this is that parents often set their expectations too high.",ontonotes5
"At an age when most kids in the West are still playing every day, our children have already started shuttling about among supplementary schools for classes in English, computers, abacus and art.",ontonotes5
"Experimental classes giving pupils the chance for self-motivated study are now being offered in some schools in Taiwan, and the results show that these children are happier and more positive.",ontonotes5
"East or the West, we're all human and we share the same values, and this applies equally to the rights of children.",ontonotes5
"In this transitional era, caught between East and West, traditional and modern, parents have to be ready to respond to new challenges all the time.",ontonotes5
"Before founding Ritek, Yeh was already a well-known figure in the Taiwan recording industry.",ontonotes5
"Although the series, as expected, didn't make any money, for three years running it won the Golden Tripod, Taiwan's highest music award.",ontonotes5
""" But my work in the recording industry brought me into contact with Peking opera, beiguan and nanguan music, and so forth.",ontonotes5
He became a major player in the Taipei music industry.,ontonotes5
"The first to bring multi-track stereo recording to Taiwan, he made a big contribution toward raising standards in the recording industry here.",ontonotes5
"It is still one of Taiwan's leading studios, having recorded such chart toppers as Luo Ta-yu's""The Small Town Lukang""and Wang Chieh's""A Game, a Dream,""as well as recent works by Chen Shan-ni.",ontonotes5
Both the cases and the machines to make them sold well all over Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"In 1990 Ritek started to press CDs, becoming the first mass-production manufacturer of CDs in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Whenever Yeh goes to Japan he happily brings back lots of Japanese books about economics and technology, such as those about third-generation mobile phones, hand-held devices and so forth.",ontonotes5
"He often cites the example of the owner of the Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya, who predicted as early as 1980, when there was a great US-Japan trade imbalance, that America would force Japan to open its beef market.",ontonotes5
"Taking hold of the opportunity, he bought a cattle ranch in America.",ontonotes5
"For the past two years, however, Japan has been open to imported beef, and Yoshinoya has done very well.",ontonotes5
Only two were chosen from Taiwan: Nien Hsing Textile and Ritek.,ontonotes5
Then at the end of November Morgan Stanley decided to include Ritek in its index of Taiwan stocks.,ontonotes5

Taiwan's Fitness Market,ontonotes5
"In the last few years, Tai-wan has been swept by a fitness fad.",ontonotes5
"It is especially noteworthy that in this new century large foreign health clubs have set their sights on the Taiwan market, hanging out their well-known shingles in a battle for market share with local firms.",ontonotes5
"This struggle has brought the fitness market to a fever pitch, and also is sparking new and diversified ideas about health in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"This health club in Taipei's fashionable eastern district, with its stylish lighting and blasting music, is more like a discotheque.",ontonotes5
"Within the last year, gleaming new health centers have set up shop in the Tong Lin Department Store in the Eastern District, the NOVA shopping center near the train station, and the Spring Galaxy theater complex in Hsimenting.",ontonotes5
And that's just in Taipei.,ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, numerous gyms, billing themselves as""recreation clubs,""have opened in the cities of Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung.",ontonotes5
The variety is bewildering and the numbers-now more than 700 locations around Taiwan-are astonishing.,ontonotes5
"Rex, an overseas Chinese from South Africa, who began his career as a trainer at California Fitness Centers, took notice of this wave beginning to build three years ago, and returned to Taiwan to devote himself to the local market.",ontonotes5
"Analyzing the current direction, he says that global trends and the explosion in media have brought Western ideas of beauty to Taiwan, and the ideal of the""firm and healthy""physique is driving Taiwan consumers into the gym.",ontonotes5
""" People in Taiwan are beginning to accept that a beautiful body requires effort, and you aren't going to get a sculpted physique with vibrating massage chairs, beauty parlors, or weight-loss pills,""he says.",ontonotes5
"But people in Taiwan have never had the idea, now common in the West, that physical fitness should be part of the routine of life.",ontonotes5
"In general, you could divide the main orientations of Taiwan gyms into two basic types: local and Western.",ontonotes5
"Right now the most noteworthy foreign group in Taiwan is California Fitness Centers, which now has three gigantic branches.",ontonotes5
But it can not be denied that working out is a relatively new concept in Asia.,ontonotes5
"Hence, California's approach is to make exercise""recreational""and""fashionable. """,ontonotes5
When East meets West,ontonotes5
""" Yoga and tai-chi have not been added just for Taiwan,""says Eric Levine.",ontonotes5
"There is little tradition of athletics in Taiwan, and it is too early to talk about any uniquely local forms that can be incorporated into Western workouts.",ontonotes5
"Rex, with his many years of training experience, finds it especially notable that""women in Taiwan don't really go for the American female approach of developing muscular bodies.",ontonotes5
"Most guys in Taiwan, meanwhile, focus on the upper body, and are looking for form, rather than aiming to be hugely muscular. """,ontonotes5
"Liang Yung-hwa, manager of the Yungho branch of the Eslite bookstore, who has been working out for five years now, says that the new clubs spend too much money on lighting and on equipment that people who are really serious about working out never use, so the membership fees are three to four times those of the older gyms.",ontonotes5
Eric Levine relates that the Tong Lin branch of California has more members than any of their branches anywhere in the world.,ontonotes5
"It seems that at least as far as the operators are concerned, Taiwan health clubs are certainly working out.",ontonotes5
"The current fitness trend in Taiwan combines working out with recreation and the traditional Chinese idea of""health cultivation. """,ontonotes5
"People in ancient Rome often rubbed their bodies with oil in the public baths as a means of relieving stress, and the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing [ Classic of Roots and Herbs Discovered by Shen Nong ], the oldest Chinese medical treatise, also describes treatments which are functionally the same as aromatherapy.",ontonotes5
"Tang Ya-chun states that most health clubs in Taiwan combine aromatherapy with hydrotherapy, and include these treatments under their""spa""services.",ontonotes5

"The earliest known depiction of this toad is the""toad in the moon""found in a Han dynasty silk painting that was unearthed in the Mawangdui Tombs.",ontonotes5
"Because of the legend of Liu Hai teasing the golden toad, toads became auspicious symbols revered throughout China ever since the Eastern Han dynasty -LRB- AD 25-220 -RRB-.",ontonotes5

"Support from the then-representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New Zealand, R.C. Shih, was an important element in the event's success.",ontonotes5
"A few years ago, when New Zealand was newly opened up to immigration and there weren't many Chinese around, hardly anyone had heard of the Hua-Hsia Association, and inviting government officials to attend such events was always fraught with difficulty.",ontonotes5
"The fact that the Association has supported charitable causes in New Zealand for many years, donating time and money, has been especially important in terms of getting taken seriously by the government, and it is thanks to the efforts of immigrants from Taiwan that successes like the New Year celebration have become possible.",ontonotes5
"For our family, it was our tenth year in New Zealand since arriving as immigrants.",ontonotes5
"As a Howick resident and a floral designer, how could I refuse?",ontonotes5
"With the steady introduction of Chinese culture into this country, New Zealanders are generally more aware of Taiwan than before, and immigrants from Taiwan have been working hard to soften the anti-Asian sentiments of the locals.",ontonotes5
"When the program of New Year performances wrapped up, many New Zealand friends came forward to express their thanks, saying that they now felt more familiar with China and were eagerly looking forward to next year's""Howick in the Park ""!",ontonotes5

Overdevelopment of the hillside at Las Colinas may have been one cause of the landslide that buried the residential neighborhood down below.,ontonotes5

"In 1937, following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Japan occupied Beiping and launched a full-scale invasion of China.",ontonotes5
"For three months he marched with an expeditionary force to the malaria-infested jungles of Burma, and then on to India, before making a safe return.",ontonotes5
"Unable to get news of Wang's whereabouts she took herself, along with another young woman -LRB- who brought her baby son and was also seeking her husband -RRB- from Jiangxi Province to China's southwest.",ontonotes5
"Says Chang:""This is one he made in Chongqing.",ontonotes5
"Something new, something old",ontonotes5
"Wang passed away in his sleep at the ripe old age of 90, and it is said in art circles that he died with a smile on his face.",ontonotes5
"However, Wang himself was alert to the risk of his calligraphy becoming over-refined, and he began incorporating the robustness of the beibei style into his brushwork, aiming for a style that was more""raw and intense. """,ontonotes5
"When he was in his fifties Wang came to regard""writing characters""as a form of painting, and he began to innovate and experiment with the art.",ontonotes5
"He tried using deliberately crumpled paper to produce a mottled effect with the ink, and worked on a blurring effect, achieved by briefly dousing a freshly painted silk scroll in water.",ontonotes5
"When students or friends of his traveled to Japan he used to ask them to bring back works on Japanese calligraphy, or books and magazines from mainland China.",ontonotes5
"Wang's calligraphy is still everywhere to be seen on the streets of Taipei, in the form of the signs for such institutions as the Kungpao Building, Taipei Teachers ' Meeting Hall, Taiwan Land Bank, and the Chunghwa Bookstore.",ontonotes5
"The exhibition of Wang's calligraphy and seal carvings, spanning every period of his creative career, runs at the National Palace Museum in Taipei from January 20 until April 15.",ontonotes5

"In a lively and well-attended ceremony on an unusually warm and sunny winter's day, the Yingko Ceramics Museum in Taipei County is formally opened to the public.",ontonotes5
The museum-located very near the Yingko interchange of the Second Northern Freeway-is hopping with people scurrying and working inside and out.,ontonotes5
"In the main hall on the first floor stand more than a dozen giant porcelain vases, representing the pottery industry of Yingko.",ontonotes5
"Cheng Yung-gwo, who is addressed by the respectful title""Teacher Cheng""by all the museum staff high and low, is one of the Young Turks on the Taiwan ceramics scene.",ontonotes5
But the most important reason why the Yingko Ceramics Museum gave him sole and total control over the recreation of the 36 pieces of prehistoric pottery in the exhibit is this: He is the only leading ceramicist in all of Taiwan who also graduated from university with a degree in archeology.,ontonotes5
A great deal of effort has been devoted to opening new museums in Taiwan in recent years.,ontonotes5
"Examples include the National Museum of Prehistory, Taipei County's Yingko Ceramics Museum and Shihsanhang Museum, and the privately founded Sheng Ye Museum of Formosan Aborigines.",ontonotes5
""" We felt that Taiwan ceramics should cover more than just what Han Chinese people have done in the 400 years since large-scale migration began from the mainland, but should also include aboriginal and prehistoric pottery.",ontonotes5
Liu I-chang is renowned in the archeological community in Taiwan for his field research.,ontonotes5
His ambition is to uncover the relationship between Taiwan's indigenous peoples and its prehistoric cultures.,ontonotes5
He previously worked on special exhibitions of Chihshanyen and Yuanshan culture and also for the Taiwan Provincial Museum.,ontonotes5
But never before had he been given a task as challenging as making reproductions representing all the major sites of prehistoric pottery in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
For this reason Cheng made a special trip to the Linkou Plateau to collect red clay.,ontonotes5
The reconstruction of an Ilan square-patterned pottery jar found by Liu I-chang in the town of Chiushe is a good illustration of Cheng's whole approach.,ontonotes5
Cheng found further indirect confirmation of his judgement about the technical skills possessed by prehistoric makers of pottery from a documentary on Japan's NHK network.,ontonotes5
"In the film, a Japanese ceramic artist, an individual who is considered a""national treasure""of Japan, goes to visit a small island in Indonesia where everybody makes pottery.",ontonotes5
"After mulling over his experiences, Cheng decided that he is going to save up money to build the finest wood-fire pottery kiln in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"This could not only restore the relationship between fire and potter, but could also induce Taiwan's ceramic artists-among whom Cheng believes there is currently too much division and distance-to cooperate with each other.",ontonotes5
"Beside a road in Emei Rural Township in Hsinchu, the kind of narrow, winding mountain road where you need to beep your horn continually to warn possible oncoming cars around the corner, in the home that he and his wife Shen Tung-ching built with their own hands, just next to a pond surrounded by all kinds of large trees, Cheng Yung-gwo dreams of himself sitting with a group of friends and colleagues around a fire,""alternately firing pottery and drinking wine. """,ontonotes5
Cheng Yung-gwo's reproductions of prehistoric pottery are on display in the Taipei County Yingko Ceramics Museum.,ontonotes5
"In the process of reproducing a jar with a square pattern, unearthed at Chiushe in Ilan County, Cheng not only continually reworked the clay, but also recreated the square pattern by striking the clay with a stick carved with the same design.",ontonotes5
His father is a native of Hunan Province in mainland China and his mother is an Amis.,ontonotes5
"Mayaw Biho, who calls himself half Amis, grew up in the Amis village of Cero -LRB- Chunjih -RRB- in Hualien County.",ontonotes5
He never lived away from the village until he went to study cinematography at Taipei's Shih Hsin University.,ontonotes5
"After coming to live in the city, Mayaw gradually came to realize how mainstream society in Taiwan regards the island's aboriginal peoples, and became aware of the gap between reporting and reality.",ontonotes5
King of Taiwan's Snakes,ontonotes5
"Although Taiwan has over 50 snake species, by far the most popular choice for the snake was the hundred-pace viper.",ontonotes5
The hundred-pace viper represents a guardian spirit who protects the Paiwan in their homeland around Mt. Tawu.,ontonotes5
"In the Paiwan village of Pingho, one of the two most important festivals was the Hundred-Pacer Festival, which used to be held once every ten years.",ontonotes5
""" Perhaps today we no longer believe in them as spirits, but they are still important symbols for the people of Mt. Tawu. """,ontonotes5
Taiwan's top five,ontonotes5
"In subtropical Taiwan, with its many native snakes, there were once snake research institutes and snake shops everywhere, and people made use of all kinds of snake products-snake meat, snake blood, snake penis, snake skin, and snake venom.",ontonotes5
One in five of Taiwan's 50-odd species of land snakes are poisonous.,ontonotes5
"The five best known and most frequently exploited are the Taiwan habu -LRB- Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus -RRB-, the Taiwan cobra -LRB- Naja naja atra -RRB-, the Chinese green tree viper -LRB- Trimeresurus stejnegeri -RRB-, the Taiwan banded krait -LRB- Bungarus multicinctus -RRB- and the hundred-pace viper -LRB- Deinagkistrodon acutus, aka the sharp-nosed pit viper -RRB-.",ontonotes5
Most of Taiwan's venomous snakes live in low-altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside.,ontonotes5
"But the hundred-pace viper, which was never very numerous, is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern, central and southern Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"According to the report""A Survey of the Commercial Exploitation and Hunting of Taiwanese Snakes""by Lin Hua-ching of Taipei Zoo, hundred-pace vipers sell for three times as much as Taiwan's other poisonous snakes, and have been known to fetch upward of NT$ 10,000 per catty -LRB- 600 grams -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"During Taiwan's period under Japanese rule, injuries caused by poisonous snakes were a frequent occurrence, so in the 1930s Tu Tsung-ming of Taihoku Imperial -LRB- later National Taiwan -RRB- University Medical College began studying poisonous snakes, and started a trend of research into snake venom antiserums.",ontonotes5
"As the fingers of development pushed up into Taiwan's mountains and forests, hundred-pacers were forced into retreat everywhere, and in 1989 the Council of Agriculture put the snake on the endangered species list.",ontonotes5
But is the hundred-pacer really the most fearsome cold-blooded killer of all Taiwan's poisonous snakes?,ontonotes5
"Chen Tsun-kuan, a section chief at the CDC, states that among Taiwan's""top five""poisonous snakes, the hundred-pacer in fact has the weakest venom.",ontonotes5
"In recent years, Tu and his research students have gradually researched the ecology of the viper species Trimeresurus gracilis, which is endemic to Taiwan, and of the Chinese green tree viper.",ontonotes5
It was only when Taipei Zoo began a hundred-pacer breeding program that people had the opportunity to understand the true face of Taiwan's hundred-pace vipers.,ontonotes5
"Lin Hua-ching, curator of the zoo's rescue center for amphibians and reptiles, says that the year before last there were six hundred-pacers in the rescue center which had been confiscated from a snake shop in Panchiao.",ontonotes5
"In August last year, as Taiwan was being buffeted by a typhoon, over 20 eggs hatched out into tiny snakes, which the zoo hopes can grow up safe and sound.",ontonotes5
"The hundred-pacer is the guardian spirit of the Paiwan aborigines, who live around southern Taiwan's Mt. Tawu.",ontonotes5
Taiwan is currently being gripped by a wave of nostalgia.,ontonotes5
"If the film In the Mood for Love, starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung, shows the face of Hong Kong in the 1960s, what Ko Ching-hua's book Rising Tide reveals is a story of old Taipei, and the author's little-known tragic and difficult childhood.",ontonotes5
"For old Taipei folk in their 50s and 60s, perhaps Ko Ching-hua's Rising Tide can help them rediscover the feel of that age which was theirs.",ontonotes5
"There are the joys and sorrows of the author's childhood and teenage years; there are the twists and turns of his love, marriage and his first excursions into the literary world; there is the nostalgia of an old Taipei resident for Taipei's past; and there is also the beautiful story of a literary gardener tilling the soil of his dreams.",ontonotes5
"Ko Ching-hua -LRB- whose close friends call him""Old K""-RRB- can be called the doyen of Taiwan's literary world.",ontonotes5
"His ancestral home was in Yongjia, Zhejiang Province.",ontonotes5
"Born in Shanghai in 1937, at the age of seven he was taken by his parents to Kunshan in Jiangsu Province, to be looked after by a family named Gu.",ontonotes5
"When he was ten, his father brought him to Taiwan, via Shanghai.",ontonotes5
"After they disembarked at Keelung, Ko Ching-hua wept all the way as they walked from the pier, past Jen-ai Road and to their home in Ningpo West Street.",ontonotes5
This moment of childish wonder raised the curtain on the drama of his life in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"Ko Ching-hua's father Ko Hao was a graduate of the foreign languages department at Hangzhou's Zhijiang University, and taught English at Taipei First Girls ' High School.",ontonotes5
Ko Ching-hua's status in Taiwan's publishing business goes without saying.,ontonotes5
"Walking amid the hubbub of Taipei today, on streets filled with people and traffic, Ko-nan Street, Shanghai Road, the Tri-Service Stadium and the Star Cafe have long since drifted away like the sound of Ko Lan's mambo song.",ontonotes5

"The US's present middle-aged generation have metamorphosed from youthful anti-war protesters and hippies into yuppie managers of multinational corporations, and from idealists into materialists.",ontonotes5
"By contrast, although Taiwan had its own baby boom from 1951 to 1966, its middle-aged generation have not had the same life experiences, so while they too have their midlife crises, they are much less complex.",ontonotes5

"When he was 38, Chao Ning, who is now a director of the Buddhist satellite TV station LTV and the producer of many Buddhist TV programs, was invited to Houston, Texas to give a lecture.",ontonotes5

"Having dragged on since 27 October last year, the furore over the cancellation of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant project was briefly laid to rest on 13 February 2001, when Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng signed an agreement to resume construction of the plant.",ontonotes5
"On one side of the argument is the unquenchable thirst for economic advance; on the other, the long-term ideal of a nuclear-free homeland, and the distress of the people of Kungliao, where the plant is sited.",ontonotes5
"Standing at the nuclear crossroads, buffeted by the waves of political turmoil sparked by the project, how should Taiwan choose its road for the future?",ontonotes5
"On 14 February, in a statement in which he spoke of a""painful choice""and his""undying determination,""Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced the resumption of work on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, and identified the passing of a plebiscite law as the most important topic for renewed cross-party consultation.",ontonotes5

"The same day, the cabinet approved the plan to resume construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, and announced that it would formulate a plan for the phased closure and decommissioning of the three existing nuclear plants, on condition that adequate electricity generating capacity is maintained.",ontonotes5
"At the cabinet meeting, economic affairs minister Lin Hsin-yi stressed that the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant project would be completed on time in July 2005.",ontonotes5
"The saga of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant began in 1980, when TaiPower first proposed the project.",ontonotes5
"In view of projections that in 2005 northern Taiwan will have a shortfall of close to 2,100 megawatts, construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant should continue, but no further nuclear plants would be built, and the first, second and third plants would be decommissioned on reaching the end of their normal operating lives.",ontonotes5
"Lien also expressed the opinion that when formulating its overall energy policy, the new government should give consideration to various factors, including environmental impact and Taiwan's international reputation.",ontonotes5
"However, with the resumption of work on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, the people of Kungliao Rural Township have nothing to show for more than a decade of protest.",ontonotes5
"This shows that Yenliao Bay really is one of northern Taiwan's major marine habitats, and is also one of the places in northern Taiwan where a coastal ecosystem has been preserved relatively undamaged.",ontonotes5
"But environmentalists are convinced that the marine habitat of Yenliao, lying within a marine resource conservation area immensely rich in both the number of species and their populations, will be devastated, and that the three-kilometer golden beach of fine quartz sand which runs from Yenliao to Fulung, one of the priceless ecological and tourist resources of the northeast coast, may be lost along with it.",ontonotes5

Taiwan Toils with Double Trouble--Forest Fires Burn and Oil Spill Bubbles,ontonotes5
"With the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out over the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant, a cargo ship ran quietly aground in mid-January just offshore from the Lungkeng Ecological Protection Area in Kenting National Park.",ontonotes5
"In the meantime, Taiwan has been hit by a rash of forest fires.",ontonotes5
"The armed forces dispatched thousands of soldiers to deal with the oil spill at Lungkeng, located at the southern tip of Taiwan, and the first phase of the cleanup was completed on February 16 with the removal of over 300 tons of oil from the shore.",ontonotes5
"Due to a lack of comprehensive studies, the local environment in Lungkeng is not sufficiently understood.",ontonotes5
The oil spill occurred at about 5 p.m. on January 14 when the Greek freighter MV Amorgos carrying ore from India to the port of Nantong in mainland China ran aground about a kilometer off the cape at Oluanpi.,ontonotes5
The disaster has hit the uplifted coral at Lungkeng the hardest.,ontonotes5
"He went through a shipping agent in Taiwan to hire local residents in Lungkeng to clean up the shoreline, but the oil slick had mucked up a three-kilometer stretch of strikingly beautiful blue waters, throwing a pall over the local tourism and fishing industries.",ontonotes5
The ship's captain and other ship officers had to post bond before they were allowed to leave Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"Although the recent spill in Taiwan was small in comparison with 10,000-ton spills that have occurred elsewhere, the situation here is worrisome because, as a petroleum importer, oil tankers ply the waters around our island in swarms.",ontonotes5
"While acknowledging the necessity of drafting emergency response plans, academics argue that an even more pressing task facing the government is to catalog Taiwan's marine resources.",ontonotes5
The lack of a detailed understanding of the Lungkeng ecology presents a perfect case in point.,ontonotes5
"Similarly, after the recent spate of forest fires in central and southern Taiwan, scholars have again reacted by calling on the government to begin as soon as possible with ongoing studies of Taiwan's forest habitats.",ontonotes5
Investigations have shown that most of the recent forest fires plaguing Taiwan have been caused by campfires.,ontonotes5
"Although the recent fires have been put out fairly quickly, a blaze on Snow Mountain caused alarm when it burned near a stand of rare Chinese hemlock as well as streams that are home to the Formosan landlocked salmon, which is regarded as a national treasure.",ontonotes5
"Chao Jung-tai, a researcher at Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, feels that the public ought to take the forest fires and the oil spill in Lungkeng as warnings of the urgent need to understand the environment in which we live.",ontonotes5

"Together with schools not participating in this pilot program, by the end of 1997 there were already 112 primary schools in Taipei City teaching English -LRB- 75% of the total -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"That same year, Kaohsiung City selected 77 primary schools to implement a comprehensive English language program for grades 5 and 6, while in other areas, such as Taipei County, Ilan County and Yunlin County, the Bureau of Education was giving more urgency to the promotion of English in primary schools.",ontonotes5
"In 1998, the President of the Academia Sinica, Lee Yuan-tseh, indicated to a meeting of the Science and Technology Committee of the Executive Yuan that because English had been taught in Taiwan as a""discipline""rather than as a""communication tool,""Taiwanese who went to study overseas found they were unable to read what their professors had prescribed in the time available.",ontonotes5
"Morris Chang, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, echoed these sentiments, pointing out that compared with Hong Kong and Singapore, the English competency of our high school and tertiary graduates is inadequate for any practical use.",ontonotes5
This is affecting Taiwan's access to information and acting as a barrier to increasing our productivity.,ontonotes5
"In actual fact, English for children was already popular all over Taiwan even before these moves.",ontonotes5
"In 1997 associate professor Chang Hsien-ta of the National Taiwan University Linguistics Research Institute investigated whether or not a""second language""was being taught in public and privately run kindergartens in Taipei City and County, and Hsinchu City and County, and found that 79% were doing so.",ontonotes5
In Taipei City the figure was 90%.,ontonotes5
"In the current climate of almost unanimous community support for the expansion of English teaching into early education, the primary schools of Taipei City with its rich resources, were the first to pilot this, but the investment of the parents has also been crucial.",ontonotes5

A Chinese Director Makes Her Mark in Australia,ontonotes5
"Clara Law, who has earned renown in Australia for Floating Life and The Goddess of 1967, is yet another ethnic Chinese filmmaker winning awards at international festivals.",ontonotes5
"How did Law, one of the last working woman directors from Hong Kong and Taiwan, attain Australian government film grants after emigrating there?",ontonotes5
"Law explains that their decision to move to Australia was a well-laid plan, not a spur-of-the-moment thing.",ontonotes5
"In 1993-1994, after shooting Fruit Punch and Temptation of a Monk in Hong Kong, the couple went to Australia to visit relatives and rest.",ontonotes5
""" The biggest problem with making films in Hong Kong is the lack of money budgeted for post-production,""Law notes.",ontonotes5
"They were extremely disappointed with the sound on Autumn Moon, so they decided to go to Australia to redo it.",ontonotes5
""" Originally, we thought that we were just changing workplaces and would spend half the year in Australia writing and then half the year in Hong Kong shooting,""Law says.",ontonotes5
""" We didn't expect that it would be our destiny to put down roots in Australia. """,ontonotes5
"So as to seek creative inspiration and find new material in a foreign land, the two bought a four-wheel-drive SUV and explored all over Australia.",ontonotes5
"Law, who has now finished nine films, was born in Macao in 1957.",ontonotes5
"She directed 12 different TV movies before going to London to get her masters in 1982, where she majored in screenplay writing and directing.",ontonotes5
"Her first film after graduating was the 1988 work The Other Half and the Other Half, which explored the uncomfortable problem of spouses being separated by national boundaries, a familiar situation in Hong Kong, which is a cradle of emigration.",ontonotes5
It was the first Hong Kong film to deal with this theme.,ontonotes5
Yet Hong Kong movies weren't acknowledging this problem.,ontonotes5
""" Although the story is intentionally macabre,""noted the Hong Kong critic Shek Kei,""the film displays Law's own style and succeeds with both its twists of plot and its portrayal of desire and killing for love.",ontonotes5
"The wife, played by Maggie Cheung, first receives permission to leave for America.",ontonotes5
"Her husband, played by Leung, smuggles himself into America to try to find her.",ontonotes5
""" When she was struggling to get out of China, she would never have expected that she would end up like this in America,""wrote one woman on the Internet.",ontonotes5
"But when I was 25 and went to America, I discovered that it was quite true to life. """,ontonotes5
"Much to her surprise, the awards committee refused her application because the film lacked a distributor in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Although not allowed to compete for a Golden Horse, it won the Gold Leopard Award at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland, and with this award Law began to receive notice in the international film community.",ontonotes5
"Autumn Moon, which was shot with Japanese money, depicts a Japanese man who goes to Hong Kong as a tourist when he is bored with his life.",ontonotes5
"The girl's parents have already emigrated to Canada, leaving her behind with her grandmother.",ontonotes5
"Based on a novel by Hong Kong's Lillian Lee, the film was entirely shot in the mainland and explores themes of sexual desire and Zen Buddhism.",ontonotes5
""" Nevertheless, her characters are the biggest disappointments in the whole film,""wrote the Hong Kong critic Shek Kei.",ontonotes5
The story is set on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to the PRC.,ontonotes5

Floating Life was the first film that Clara Law made after moving to Australia.,ontonotes5
""" It's the new Australian Law, not the old Hong Kong Law. """,ontonotes5
"Law seems to have found new creative energy in Australia, where both her works have been about how people try to find themselves in the modern world.",ontonotes5
"Elegant Clara Law came to Taiwan for the Taipei Film Festival, where film buffs had the opportunity to see her new work, The Goddess of 1967.",ontonotes5
"Floating Life, which was shot on an Australian government grant, describes what happens to a Hong Kong family with five children when they move to Australia before Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule.",ontonotes5
A Southeast Asian Singing Star Shines in Taiwan--Sun Yan Zi,ontonotes5
In the year 2000 a singer in Taiwan re-leased her debut album in the middle of the year and has been hot ever since.,ontonotes5
"With this share, she surpassed even A-Mei, the reigning queen of Taiwan pop.",ontonotes5
"Sun Yan Zi, this 23-year-old from Singapore hasn't been here a full year, but her efforts are already bearing ample fruit.",ontonotes5
And Does her success show that singers from Southeast Asia have successfully established a foothold in Taiwan?,ontonotes5
""" Dark Skies,""Sun's first hit last June, caused an immediate sensation.",ontonotes5
"People found Sun's singing voice fresh, clean and infectiously charming, and it quickly earned her a place in Taiwan's music world.",ontonotes5
"Members of the media have quipped that those who work at Taiwan's Warner Music can thank two Singaporeans, Sun and her producer Li, for any bonuses they made last year.",ontonotes5
Now people have started wondering if overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia-and in particular from Singapore and Malaysia-are taking over the mainstream of the Taiwanese music industry.,ontonotes5
"But in the last five years or so, there has been a steady stream of Southeast Asian singers making their mark in Taiwan: Mavis Hee, Mindy, Kit Chan, Tanya Chua, Michael and Victor, Angelica Lee, Penny, Fish Leong, and Tae Kheng Seong.",ontonotes5
"Although the Southeast Asians haven't had quite the impact of the returning overseas Chinese from North America, they have staked out their piece of the pop music field.",ontonotes5
"Music critic Tsai Yun-pu notes that the Southeast Asian singers are not as recognizable as their counterparts from North America, who have a hard-rocking, R&B style.",ontonotes5
""" Taiwan is now the capital of Mandarin pop music worldwide,""says Tsai.",ontonotes5
"The market is too small in Southeast Asia, so it has become de rigueur for Southeast Asian Chinese singers to come to Taiwan to advance their careers.",ontonotes5
"Although there may not be much that sets the Southeast Asians apart, the growing exchange of musical talent between Taiwan and Southeast Asia has at least provided ample content for the gossip pages.",ontonotes5
"At that moment, Taiwan didn't seem to be that far from Singapore, despite the latter's endless summer weather.",ontonotes5
Sun Yan Zi's androgynous style and clean and fresh image have quickly made her famous in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"From Wen Chang in the 1980s -LRB- center photo by Chen Tsai-fu -RRB-, to Michael and Victor in the 1990s -LRB- right photo by Lin Ching-yang -RRB-, to Mindy Kit -LRB- bottom photo courtesy of Warner Music -RRB- of the current decade, Southeast Asian singers have a long history of coming to Taiwan to advance their careers.",ontonotes5
"Last year, nearly one million travelers from Taiwan passed through Macau Airport, heading for mainland China or visiting Macau itself, and accounting for 80% of passengers using the airport.",ontonotes5
"Around 1,000 of Macau's civil servants have studied in Taiwan, and every year some 30,000 people travel from Macau to Taiwan for business or work, along with more than 400 students.",ontonotes5
"But against the backdrop of continued proclamations from the PRC about how""Macau's ' one country two systems ' arrangement sets an example for solving the Taiwan problem,""these figures, along with the Taiwan-Macau exchanges that they represent, have been willfully neglected by Macau's mainstream media.",ontonotes5
Macau and Taiwan: so near and yet so far.,ontonotes5
"On December 19, 1999, the eve of Macau's transfer of sovereignty, the China Times in Taiwan published a survey on the Taiwanese public's views about Macau's return to Chinese control.",ontonotes5
"According to the survey, 31% of people in Taiwan weren't even aware that Macau was about to be handed back to China, while 53% answered that they didn't know whether the handover would be beneficial or harmful for Macau's development.",ontonotes5
"But when asked whether the""one country two systems""formula, as used for Hong Kong and Macau, was acceptable for Taiwan, 59% responded""No,""while 27% said that they didn't know.",ontonotes5
"As these results clearly indicate, the people of Taiwan still know little about Macau, in spite of existing exchanges, and more than half of them flatly reject Beijing's""one country two systems""formula-so readily taken up in Macau-as a solution to the Taiwan question.",ontonotes5
It takes just an hour and a half to fly from Taiwan to Macau.,ontonotes5
"You catch the first flight to Macau in the morning, stop at the Westin for a coffee and to talk business, head to one of the outlying islands in the afternoon for a round of golf, take a stroll downtown, and return to Taiwan that evening. """,ontonotes5
What path will the relationship follow now that Macau has returned to China?,ontonotes5
"Rosa Tam, who heads the recruitment and selection division of the directorate's human resources department, introduces many of her colleagues with the remark that he or she""studied in Taiwan too. """,ontonotes5
"Tam herself graduated from the department of educational psychology at National Taiwan Normal University in 1985, and joined Macau's department of education in 1987, before eventually moving to the directorate of administration and rising to the post of division chief in just 11 years.",ontonotes5
Tam is just one of the many Macau civil servants who have studied for degrees in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"The Macau government's directorate for administration says that around 200 Macau civil servants have academic qualifications from Taiwan, but according to Taiwan's representative office in the territory, the figure is closer to 1,000.",ontonotes5
"This may not represent a very large share of Macau's 17,000 civil servants, but given that many of those who graduated in Taiwan hold senior ranks, it adds something of a""Taiwan flavor""to the government of the Macau SAR -LRB- Special Administrative Region -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"In contrast, Taiwan alumni are noticeable by their absence from the SAR government in Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
"At present, the most senior government official to have studied in Taiwan is Ou Wenlong, who graduated in mechanical engineering at National Taiwan University -LRB- NTU -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"Ou is Macau's secretary for transportation and public works, and has been appointed by Chief Executive Edmund Ho as one of the SAR government's five administration secretaries.",ontonotes5
"Amid all the hype surrounding Macau's incorporation under the""one country two systems""formula, the sensitive issue of the""Taiwan connection""within the Macau government is little discussed.",ontonotes5
"As the clearest example of this connection, Ou Wenlong is one official that many journalists from Taiwan have tried to get an interview with, but their requests have all been turned down on the grounds that the secretary is""too busy. """,ontonotes5
"He did nevertheless find time to do an interview with Hong Kong's Phoenix TV, during which he discoursed freely on the subject of Macau's development.",ontonotes5
"On the eve of the handover, the signboard of the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau was quietly taken down, after the office had been privately warned to remove the sign before the transfer of sovereignty.",ontonotes5
"of the above was problems at the time of Hong Kong's handover in 1997, which goes to show how cautious the Macau SAR government is regarding Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"When senior Macau officials are asked about having studied in Taiwan, they are always quick to add mention of other academic qualifications obtained in Macau, Lisbon, or mainland China.",ontonotes5
""" It's called sanitizing your record!""quips Tan Zhiqiang, Hong Kong and Macau bureau chief for the China Times, who was born and raised in Macau and wrote his doctoral dissertation on""The Question of Macau's Sovereignty. """,ontonotes5
"The more senior a government official is, the more defensive he is likely to be on the subject of his studies in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
""" It doesn't matter where you studied and where you graduated,""says Chen Mingying, a senior official in the Macau government's news department.",ontonotes5
"Another graduate of a Taiwan institution declares bluntly that he only spent four years in Taiwan getting his degree, and the place had virtually no effect on him at all.",ontonotes5
"Nevertheless, there has been a steady stream of students from Macau to Taiwan ever since 1955.",ontonotes5
"According to statistics from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, around 6,000 have come in the past ten years, and Professor Wong Hon Keong of Macau University's Macau Research Center says that 30% of middle school graduates in the territory have sat the overseas enrolment test for college in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Around 600 candidates passed the test last year, and there are on average 1,600-2,000 students from Macau at university in Taiwan at any one time.",ontonotes5
Perhaps the reason for the apparent lack of attachment to Taiwan among the many returned Taiwan alumni can be traced to historical factors.,ontonotes5
"In 1966, Macau was convulsed by rioting in which several people were shot and killed by Portuguese security forces.",ontonotes5
"The enclave's left-wing groups, which were closely allied with Beijing, took advantage of the situation to get KMT organizations in Macau shut down and their people expelled.",ontonotes5
"Ever since, Macau has been regarded in certain circles in Taiwan as a""semi-liberated area. """,ontonotes5
"But if Macau's pro-Beijing forces are that strong, how come so many students come to Taiwan to get their degrees?",ontonotes5
""" There are historical reasons for this too,""says Ou Jinrong, former president of Macau's Taiwan Alumni Association and a member both of the Macau SAR's first Selection Committee, and its Preparatory Committee.",ontonotes5
"Prior to the 1980s, Macau lacked its own colleges, and students had to go overseas for higher education.",ontonotes5
"Also, colleges on the mainland didn't start enrolling overseas students until the mid-1980s, while it was difficult to gain admission to university in Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
""" In terms of the return you get on your investment, taking your degree in Taiwan is well worth it,""says Wang Yun, acting head of the sanitation and environment division of Macau's urban administration office, who graduated in civil engineering from National Cheng Kung University -LRB- NCKU -RRB- in Tainan.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan's universities have good teachers and decent facilities, says Wang, and students from Macau can learn much in Taiwan that will benefit them in their careers.",ontonotes5
"Unlike the colonial administration in Hong Kong, the government of Macau under the Portuguese recognized academic credentials issued by Taiwanese institutions.",ontonotes5
"It was only in the mid-1980s, once the timetable for the handover of Hong Kong and Macau had been agreed, that the government began to localize the civil service in preparation for the transition to""Macau people running Macau. """,ontonotes5
"A number of graduates who had returned from Taiwan to work in the private sector then shifted to government jobs, and have come to form an influential part of the administration.",ontonotes5
"Compared with the many Macau students who went to the mainland to study from the mid-1980s onwards, those who graduated in Taiwan returned and joined the civil service earlier, and seem to have made faster progress in their careers.",ontonotes5
""" There's no denying that Taiwan universities have given us a good education,""smiles Leong Hong Sai, secretary of Macau's Taiwan Universities Alumni Association.",ontonotes5
"In addition to the government officials who studied in Taiwan, many returned graduates have become influential in Macau through their success in the private sector.",ontonotes5
"Leong Man Io, current president of the Taiwan Universities Alumni Association, who graduated in civil engineering from NCKU, is one of Macau's most prominent civil engineers.",ontonotes5
He has supervised several major projects such as landscaping Macau's Maritime Museum and setting up venues for the handover events.,ontonotes5
"Unlike neighboring Hong Kong in 1997, there was no public backlash in Macau on the occasion of the handover, and no exodus of emigrants.",ontonotes5
"Leong Kam Chun says:""Hong Kong began nurturing local administrative talent in the mid-1970s, whereas Macau only started doing so ten years later, in the mid-1980s.",ontonotes5
"Gary Mei, executive director of the Sino-Latino Foundation of Macau, points out that during their four centuries in Macau the Portuguese never attempted to build up the Portuguese language ability of the local people.",ontonotes5
This presents enormous difficulties for the localization into Chinese of Macau's mass of colonial era laws.,ontonotes5
"Due to the chronic dearth of qualified personnel among Macau's judiciary, much of the work of legal localization depends on experts from the mainland.",ontonotes5
"But according to Gary Mei,""The socialist law that they are used to on the mainland is out of synch with the capitalist-type law of Macau, in terms both of attitude and spirit. """,ontonotes5
"But legal professionals who have studied in Taiwan, where legal concepts are closer to those that hold in Macau, can play an important role in this localization process.",ontonotes5
"From Taiwan's perspective, how can these Taiwan alumni benefit the Taiwan-Macau relationship?",ontonotes5
"Ou Jinrong frankly notes that Yue Meizhen, former vice-director of the Taiwan Affairs section of the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua Agency, once encouraged the alumni to""do more to be a bridge between the two sides. """,ontonotes5
"And in April, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council invited members of the Taiwan Universities Alumni Association on a visit back to Taiwan,""to hear our views on Taiwan-Macau relations,""says Leong Hong Sai.",ontonotes5
"Wong Hon Keong, deputy director of the Macau Research Center at Macau University, says that the presence of these Taiwan alumni in Macau""makes it easier for the Taiwanese to get things done,""and he feels that this is an asset for Taiwan in terms of developing relations with Macau.",ontonotes5
"William Li, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Macau, also testifies to the benefits that the alumni bring for Taiwan:""If they're not too high up in the government, we generally have no problem contacting them by phone, providing information, and getting together for things like social events. """,ontonotes5
"But Tan Zhiqiang, himself a returned alumni, points out while it's fine having dinner together, if it ever came to it, none of the alumni would want to actively""align""themselves with Taiwan, given the pro-Beijing political climate in Macau.",ontonotes5
""" Which is closer, Taiwan or the mainland?""asks Tan.",ontonotes5
"On the other hand, political divisions are not as sharply defined in Macau as they are in Hong Kong, and people are not so uptight about who they come into contact with.",ontonotes5
"After all, Macau covers an area of just 23 sq. km -LRB- roughly equivalent to the Nankang district of Taipei -RRB- and has a population of 430,000.",ontonotes5
"As Leong Kam Chun says, Macau""still has the feel of a rural society. """,ontonotes5
"You bump into the same people all the time in Macau, and if you're too strict about factions, you only make things difficult for yourself.",ontonotes5
""" Unlike Hong Kong people, Macau people don't like to talk politics,""says Leong.",ontonotes5
"Although pro-Beijing elements prevail in Macau, the former Portuguese administration didn't seem too bothered about PRC pressure when it came to the issue of ties with Taiwan, perhaps because their only concern was for people's livelihood.",ontonotes5
Visa-free entry to Macau for Taiwanese is a case in point.,ontonotes5
"Explains Wong Hon Keong:""Macau offers visa-free access to residents of over 40 countries with which it has consular relations, but Taiwan is the only place for which it provides visa-free access without there being diplomatic ties. """,ontonotes5
"Moreover, Taiwanese officials have always had an easier time going in and out of Macau, compared with the fuss involved in getting to Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
"For example, P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, visited Macau shortly before the handover, and even figures such as mainland democracy activist Wu'er Kaixi have been admitted to Macau on their way to the mainland-though the mainland authorities of course refused to allow Wu'er to cross into the PRC.",ontonotes5
"Taiwanese businesspeople in Macau form another group that is usually thought of as only concerned about""making a living. """,ontonotes5
"Chen arrived in Macau ten years ago, and ran air-tours by light aircraft until the enclave's international airport opened, after which he moved into the liquor trade.",ontonotes5
"When he travels to the mainland he takes his Macau Resident's Permit, but when he comes back to Taiwan he uses his ROC passport.",ontonotes5
"As part of his efforts to attract more Taiwanese investors to do business in Macau, he helped introduce President Group CEO Kao Chin-yen to the territory, and in order to build better ties with the mainland Chinese, he helped the Xinhua News Agency in Macau to install satellite TV.",ontonotes5
"But when he found that his elementary-school-age grandson was speaking Cantonese all day he quickly sent him back to school in Taiwan, fearing that the boy was losing his mother tongue.",ontonotes5
"A consensus among the Taiwanese living and working in Macau is that""you can't use ideology to decide what's right and wrong. """,ontonotes5
"Another point they agree on is that not enough was done in the past to develop ties between Taiwan and Macau, but that with Macau's change of status, and the corresponding change in atmosphere, things should be different from now on.",ontonotes5
"Chen Chung-yung points out that rents in Macau are about 25% less than rents in Hong Kong, while Macau's connections with the European Union means that it enjoys tax concessions and generous trade quotas.",ontonotes5
"Chen encourages people not to worry, and hopes that they won't hesitate to invest in Macau.",ontonotes5
"Chen Ming-chih, a Taiwanese businessman based in Dongguan, points out that wages in Macau are not particularly low and there's very little spare land, no deepwater harbor and no natural resources, which explains why firms remain more interested in investing on the mainland than in Macau.",ontonotes5
""" What Macau can offer is a service base, with visa-free access, convenience of travel, and open channels of information.",ontonotes5
"With Taiwan for R&D and Zhuhai as the manufacturing base, Macau can provide a window to foreign trade, through which companies can increase their exports to the EU. """,ontonotes5
Wong's comments pinpoint the intermediary role that Macau plays between Taiwan and the mainland.,ontonotes5
"As Leong Kam Chun notes:""Because Macau is so small and sits rights next to mainland China, its economy is always vulnerable to external factors. """,ontonotes5
"As soon as the Asian financial crisis hit Hong Kong, the Macau economy was similarly affected, and unemployment reached 7%.",ontonotes5
"Moreover, the contribution made by Taiwanese businesses to Macau is even less than the spillover from Hong Kong firms investing in neighboring Zhuhai.",ontonotes5
"Apart from economics, what other forms of possible interaction can Taiwan and Macau share?",ontonotes5
Macau has been a contact point between East and West ever since Portuguese ships first arrived in the 16th century.,ontonotes5
"As Gary Mei points out, the enclave was opened to the outside world more than 300 years before Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
"During much of the Ming and Qing dynasties, when maritime trade was officially banned, Macau was the shipping hub for the""Silk Road of the Sea,""which extended as far as South Asia, Africa and Europe in one direction, and Japan, Southeast Asia and South America in the other.",ontonotes5
"Says Mei:""This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East, while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan, Lin Zexu, Liang Qichao, Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning. """,ontonotes5
"Macau emerged unscathed from WWII, and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact, providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West.",ontonotes5
"In recent years, these archives have attracted particular attention from Taiwan scholars, notes Mei, driven by interest in the history of East-West exchanges and the influence of maritime culture on their island",ontonotes5
"Furthermore, Macau also serves as an academic and cultural key to the world of the Romance languages.",ontonotes5
"As Mei explains, there are plenty of old Portuguese texts preserved in Macau, and the university has a sizeable contingent of Portuguese-speaking professors.",ontonotes5
""" Taiwanese who wish to study Portuguese don't have to go to Europe,""says Mei.",ontonotes5
""" It's enough to come to Macau. """,ontonotes5
"Though it occupies a tiny spit of land, the former Portuguese colony is home to 12 museums of art and history, more than Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
""" As economic entities go, Macau is tiny,""says Mei,""but as a store of culture it's huge.",ontonotes5
Matsu bridges the gap,ontonotes5
"Ngan In Leng, president of Macau's Fujian Association, explains that the traditional three-way ties between Macau, Taiwan and the Southern Fujian region remain to this day, and Taiwanese visitors to Macau can still see traces of Fujianese culture at locations such as Lin Fong Temple and the area around Barrier Gate.",ontonotes5
And indeed it was Fujianese fishermen who several centuries ago built the first Matsu temple here-the A-Ma-Gau from which Macau takes its name.,ontonotes5
"Ung Choi Kun, deputy chairman of Macau's Fujian General Chamber of Commerce, says that 100,000 mainlanders have moved to Macau in the past two decades, almost all of them from Fujian Province.",ontonotes5
"At present, around 30,000 people from Macau travel to Taiwan every year for work, many of them ethnic Fujianese taking advantage of family connections to the island.",ontonotes5
""" When you talk about Matsu and about hometown bonds, it's not hard finding topics that link Taiwan and Macau,""remarks Ngan In Leng.",ontonotes5
"In the realm of politics, suggests Wong Hon Keong, Macau can also serve as a""catalyst and lubricant for relations across the Taiwan Strait. """,ontonotes5
"The international airport, where flights between Taiwan and the mainland make a stopover, allows for""one-plane""travel between the two sides.",ontonotes5
"Also, the continued provision after the handover of visa-free entry for Taiwanese, along with the relative ease with which Taiwan officials can visit the SAR, testifies to Macau's flexibility in these matters.",ontonotes5
""" Macau will help to boost cross-strait relations,""says Wong Hon Keong.",ontonotes5
"But as Tan Zhiqiang points out, nearly a quarter of the residents of Macau have arrived from the mainland during the past ten years.",ontonotes5
"Unlike the British in Hong Kong, the Portuguese colonial administration always tried to minimize conflict with Beijing, promoting compromise and dialogue.",ontonotes5
"As a result there was little""anti-China""sentiment among the people of Macau at the time of the handover, in contrast to the pro-democracy mood that swept Hong Kong in 1997.",ontonotes5
""" When Taiwanese are confronted with Macau's ' pro-Beijing ' slant, they should try and be more understanding.""says Tan.",ontonotes5
"In fact, the people of Macau aren't necessarily as ecstatic about the handover as they are made out to be, and after more than 400 years of rule the Portuguese have left behind more than just European-style buildings, Portuguese food, and churches.",ontonotes5
"Indeed,""identity""is precisely what the people of Macau have been looking for.",ontonotes5
"The presence of mainland China is what bonds Taiwan and Macau, yet it is also what keeps them apart.",ontonotes5
"Strolling through downtown Macau one notices prominent signs advertising popular Taiwanese snack-stops, like Dingtaifeng Dumpling Restaurant and Quickly Iced Drinks.",ontonotes5
"Business seems to be thriving at Margaret's egg-tart bakery, whose brand name is known throughout the region and probably defines""Macau""for many in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"The excitement surrounding the handover has died down, and life in Macau goes on much as before.",ontonotes5
My Heart is in Macau:,ontonotes5
"Around the time of the Macau handover, questions that were hot in the Western media were, What is""Macaense ""?",ontonotes5
And what is native Macau culture?,ontonotes5
"Four hundred years ago, a Portuguese trading vessel dropped anchor off the island of Macau, intent on doing business with imperial China.",ontonotes5
"That one brief rest stop destined Macau to become a cultural montage that includes Chinese, Indian, Malay, Portuguese and other European influences.",ontonotes5
"Today, Macaense -LRB- or Macanese -RRB-, the free mix of the various ethnic currents of Macau has become the most vibrant element of its culture.",ontonotes5
""" Without it, Macau wouldn't exist,""says Carlos Marreiros, who once served as director of the Macau government's bureau of culture, and now works as an architect, painter, author and poet.",ontonotes5
"In Macau, he's what is known as a""local Portuguese. """,ontonotes5
"Marreiros was born in Macau, but""most of my education took place in Europe,""he says.",ontonotes5
"He attended university in Lisbon, received his master's degree in Germany, and went on to study landscaping in Sweden.",ontonotes5
His principal impressions of China come from his family and his contacts with Chinese people.,ontonotes5
"When he was young, Marreiros worked in a Macau post office.",ontonotes5
"Marreiros emphasizes that in addition to Chinese and Portuguese influences, Macau also has its own unique blend of culture-Macaense, which is exhibited in""local Portuguese""of mixed ancestry such as himself.",ontonotes5
""" The world's first mixed-race culture appeared in Macau,""he says.",ontonotes5
"Now with the convenience of travel and transportation, the intermingling of black, white and yellow peoples is nothing new, but 400 years ago, the people of Macau intertwined cultures from as far afield as India, Southeast Asia and Japan.",ontonotes5
"Their influences can be seen everywhere in the cuisine, architecture and literature of Macau.",ontonotes5
The exteriors of traditional Macau buildings are noticeably southern European in style.,ontonotes5
"The most representative example is Macau's oldest church, Sao Paolo -LRB- the ruins of St. Paul's -RRB-.",ontonotes5
Marreiros believes that the hybrid culture of Macau is its greatest asset.,ontonotes5
""" Macau is so small.",ontonotes5

""" Twenty years ago, the polyester uniforms worn by schoolchildren in Taiwan turned dreadfully stiff when you tried to wash them; cotton clothes shrank; nylon made your skin red and itchy; stockings would ladder if you so much as looked at them; and decent clothes had to be expensively dry cleaned,""recalls CTI president Yao Hsing-chuan.",ontonotes5
"If clothes in Taiwan today are getting ever lighter, softer, warmer, more wrinkle-free and easier to keep clean, and if their colors are bright, fresh and stain-resistant, this is not thanks to the magic wand wielded by Cinderella's fairy godmother, but is the result of the unceasing efforts towards research, development and upgrading put in by the textile industry over the years.",ontonotes5
"But around 1987, under strong US pressure, the NT dollar appreciated, and exporters lost their competitive price advantage.",ontonotes5
"Many firms moved production to mainland China or Southeast Asia, and Taiwan's remaining domestic textile industry was dramatically reshuffled.",ontonotes5
"With the departure of the ready-to-wear industry, Taiwan lost its""garment kingdom""status.",ontonotes5
"But looking from another perspective, the Taiwanese manufacturers who spread all over Southeast Asia, mainland China and Latin America were still very much a force to be reckoned with, and in their new locations they continued to source raw materials and semi-finished goods from Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"With their support, the upstream portions of the industry-fiber making, yarn spinning, weaving, dyeing, finishing and garment design-were able to stay in Taiwan and prosper.",ontonotes5
"In September 1998, while the industry was still reeling from the effects of the Asian financial crisis, construction began of the long-planned specialist industrial parks in Yunlin and Changhua Counties.",ontonotes5
These were the peak of the large investments made in Taiwan's textile industry over recent years.,ontonotes5
Taiwan's biggest currency earner,ontonotes5
"Nevertheless, thanks to its solid foundations built up over 40 years, the textile industry is still a pillar of Taiwan's economy.",ontonotes5
"In 1999, Taiwan's textile exports are expected to be worth US$ 14.5 billion or 12% of the island's total exports, behind only electronics -LRB- 17.6% -RRB- and IT/ telecom products -LRB- 12.3% -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"Moreover, after deducting the cost of imported raw materials etc., the textile industry is Taiwan's biggest foreign currency earner, bringing in over US$ 10 billion each year.",ontonotes5
"For instance, polyester is the most widely used man-made fiber, and little Taiwan produces no less than 17% of the total worldwide supply, making it the largest supplier.",ontonotes5
"The island's total production of man-made fibers ranks third globally, behind the USA and mainland China.",ontonotes5
"At present, the largest category among Taiwan's textile exports is finished cloth, which accounts for more than 60% of Taiwan's textile exports by value.",ontonotes5
""" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan, and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment.",ontonotes5
"CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung-fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies, and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up.",ontonotes5
"With Southeast Asia and mainland China catching up fast, Taiwan's textile industry will only have a future if it can quickly transform itself and develop towards high-tech products.",ontonotes5

"-LRB- TCH -RRB-, as yet the only company in Taiwan to manufacture nylon 66 filament, recounts that ten years ago her husband and a group of friends who had worked many years at Formosa Chemicals and Fiber Corporation wanted to set up in business for themselves.",ontonotes5
"But Taiwan had no manufacturing capability in the fiber, and relied entirely on imports.",ontonotes5
But 95% of Taiwan's textile firms are small or medium-sized enterprises.,ontonotes5
"At that time, he says, few manufacturers in Taiwan were both interested in the technology and competent to apply it.",ontonotes5
"On the one hand, the market for breathable waterproof fabrics was not yet mature, and too many companies entering all at once knocked the bottom out of the market; on the other, manufacturers in Taiwan still lack the concept of dedicating production equipment to one product.",ontonotes5

The leading volume producer of wicking fibers in Taiwan is Chung Shing Textile Company.,ontonotes5
"However, he acknowledges that although many new products are being developed in Taiwan, on closer inspection they are all copies of products first developed elsewhere, and so fall some way short of real innovation.",ontonotes5

"He notes that industries in Taiwan always pursue short-term profits, so there is never much interest in technologies which are too forward-looking and can not immediately produce saleable products.",ontonotes5
"To pursue this goal he quit his job, moved to the suburbs of Kuishan in Taoyuan County, and began to spend 18 hours a day studying the problem.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan is the world's third biggest producer of man-made fibers, but it only produces a small range of mass-market fibers for apparel fabrics, to the almost total neglect of the hundred or so other high-added-value, special fibers on the market such as high-strength fibers for bullet-proof fabrics, elastic fibers or superalloy aerospace fibers.",ontonotes5
"Again, when it comes Taiwan's biggest export item, finished fabrics, these too are largely limited to apparel fabrics, with few companies getting involved in other areas despite their potential.",ontonotes5
"For instance, Taiwan has been struck by many landslides in recent years, and requires large quantities of geotextiles-heavy-grade textiles laid under or around civil engineering structures to prevent erosion by groundwater movement.",ontonotes5

New Strategic Thinking for the Defense of Taiwan,ontonotes5
Defense thinking in Taiwan is changing to meet the challenges of advanced technology.,ontonotes5
"As the first Chinese New Year of the new millenium approaches, changes are underway which are drawing attention to the long-term prospects for military and defense affairs in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"In addition, as the presidential election battle heats up, cross-strait security issues-especially those related to missiles and missile defense-have again come up in Taiwan, with candidates rushing to put forward their own strategic thinking.",ontonotes5
"Faced with the turbulent cross-strait situation, can Taiwan's military ensure security?",ontonotes5
How should Taiwan respond to mainland China's active development of a missile attack capability?,ontonotes5
How can Taiwan defend itself without provoking an irrational response from mainland China?,ontonotes5
One is that defense of the remote Pratas and Spratley Islands will be transferred to the Coast Guard Command.,ontonotes5
He suggested that Taiwan will have to develop long-range missiles to counter the mainland Chinese military threat.,ontonotes5
"Obviously, after the experience of the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis, people in Taiwan have considered defending the island against mainland Chinese missile attack to be one of the foremost defense problems.",ontonotes5
"Interestingly, even as such""pro-active defense""ideas are being proposed, the Ministry of National Defense -LRB- MND -RRB- has made a seemingly contrary move: It has announced that military forces will be withdrawn from the remote offshore Pratas and Spratley islands, and that responsibility for these islands and for coastal patrolling will be transferred to the Coast Guard.",ontonotes5
"The MND argues that since the military is being streamlined, in order to concentrate defense forces in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, the defense of the Pratas and Spratley islands-which are in the South China Sea-and the protection of coastal fishing vessels and coastal security should be left to the Coast Guard.",ontonotes5
The stimulus for these new ideas has been the aggressive military deployments by mainland China aimed at Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"Lin Cheng-yi, a research fellow at the Institute of European and American Affairs at the Academia Sinica, says that the successful testing by mainland China of missiles in 1996 has altered the lines of strategic thought on both sides of the strait.",ontonotes5
Guided missiles have replaced aircraft as the major threat to Taiwan.,ontonotes5
In recent years mainland China has also constructed short-range surface-to-surface missile bases along its Southeast Coast which are specifically targeted at Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"According to a report in the December 22, 1999 Washington Post, in November US reconnaissance satellites discovered that the PRC had begun constructing a new air defense missile base in the Zhangzhou region along the southeast coast.",ontonotes5
"Lin Cheng-yi says that, besides rapidly building missile bases, the PRC has repeatedly stated that""there should be a timetable for resolution of the Taiwan problem. """,ontonotes5
The PRC's extremely assertive deployment of armed capability opposite Taiwan is deeply felt in the ROC.,ontonotes5
"If Taiwan does not respond in time, it will be forced into an increasingly passive position.",ontonotes5
"Lt. Gen. Fuh Wei-ku, commandant of the Air Command and General Staff College at the Armed Forces University, notes that for the moment Taiwan still has a slight edge in terms of air defense.",ontonotes5
"Although this prediction is not necessarily accurate, Taiwan should work to maintain its edge so as to guarantee peace through strength.",ontonotes5
"Fuh Wei-ku offers the following analysis: Currently the PRC weapons which pose the greatest threat to Taiwan are Sukhoi aircraft, M-class missiles, and cruise missiles.",ontonotes5
"Of these, the aircraft are already strategically of the second rank, but Taiwan must be alert to the missiles.",ontonotes5
"The M-class weapons can pass through the stratosphere directly into Taiwan's rear areas, while cruise missiles can undertake low-level long-range attacks.",ontonotes5
"From the point of view of international strategy, the US clearly does not want Taiwan to develop its own offensive missile capability.",ontonotes5
The US responded negatively to Lien Chan's proposal to build long-range missiles.,ontonotes5
"At the State Department's end-of-year press conference, US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control John Holum said that the US did not want to see Taiwan take any action which would violate the basic norms of the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime.",ontonotes5
Thus the US would not be happy to see Taiwan develop offensive long-range missile systems.,ontonotes5
"Kuo Cheng-liang, a professor of political science at Soochow University, says that the US opposes Taiwan's development of long-range missiles because of the US's long-range strategy vis-a-vis China.",ontonotes5
"The US has always been responsible for strategic deterrence, while Taiwan handles local tactical defense.",ontonotes5
"If Taiwan were to develop long-range missiles, this would change Taiwan's defensive posture, and alter the Taiwan-US military division of labor.",ontonotes5
There is another possibility for Taiwan in defending against the threat of missiles from the PRC.,ontonotes5
"Besides building offensive systems, Taiwan could also join the US Theater Missile Defense -LRB- TMD -RRB- plan.",ontonotes5
"He says that if Taiwan were to join the TMD this would be a return to a situation of joint US-Taiwan defense, such as existed during the Cold War, when Taiwan was on the frontline in a chain of islands surrounding China.",ontonotes5
"For the PRC, which is endeavoring to move from coastal defense to a blue-water capability, the provocation would be enormous.",ontonotes5
"The United States has thus been deliberately unclear-it does not exclude Taiwan from the TMD, but it has not clearly said that Taiwan would be included.",ontonotes5
"In any case, says Lin Chong-pin, vice-chairman of the ROC's Mainland Affairs Council, potential TMD buyers still do not know where the money would come from, while the TMD producer has not yet come up with a finished product.",ontonotes5
"So this is still just a political debating point, and it is too early to talk about any impact on the military situation in the Taiwan Strait.",ontonotes5
"Thus, from the international strategic angle, it still seems most practical for Taiwan to have its own missile systems.",ontonotes5
"In an analysis of the threat that guided missiles pose to morale in Taiwan, ROC Minister of Defense Tang Fei points out that perhaps for some countries a missile attack would have little impact.",ontonotes5
"But in Taiwan, where resources are concentrated, missiles pose a serious threat to electrical power and petroleum production, to transportation -LRB- harbors, highways, airports, railroads -RRB-, and to factories.",ontonotes5
"More importantly, he says, the citizens of Taiwan are not psychologically prepared.",ontonotes5
"If the PRC were to launch 200-300 guided missiles against Taiwan, although the damage to industry, power, and communications would probably not be as serious as was caused by the September 21 earthquake, citizens are not psychologically prepared for war, and the economy might not be able to withstand the assault.",ontonotes5
"Chung Chien, an expert on military affairs, says that the turbulence created in the public mind by the 1996 PRC missile tests has not abated even today.",ontonotes5
The construction of an effective missile defense system is the main military problem in bringing peace of mind to Taiwan citizens.,ontonotes5
"If Taiwan can not develop long-range missiles or participate in the TMD plan, what effective strategic options are left?",ontonotes5
Fuh Wei-ku points out that Taiwan's domestically produced Sky Bow and Sky Sword missiles have defensive capability.,ontonotes5
"Taiwan's domestically produced Hsiung Feng missiles have over-the-horizon attack capability, and could remain the main focus of future research and development.",ontonotes5
"Lin Cheng-yi says that it is indeed feasible for Taiwan's military to develop an effective retaliatory capability; development could focus on short-range SSMs and an air-to-surface attack capability, which could expand the battlefield beyond Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"For example, South Korea has developed its own SSMs, Singapore has airborne refueling capability, and Israel has a strategy of keeping the fighting outside its borders as much as possible.",ontonotes5
"PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration, it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way.",ontonotes5
"Although constructing a missile system is a main focus of defense thinking in Taiwan, effective use of high-tech weaponry depends on the quality of military personnel and, moreover, can not be seen as a panacea for all defense problems.",ontonotes5
"Fuh Wei-ku says that the problem is not one of integrating the different types of weaponry bought from the""mini-United Nations""of sources from which Taiwan has acquired high-tech arms, because the military accounted for this problem already.",ontonotes5
"At the ceremony marking the commissioning of the fifth F-16 squadron held last December in Hualien, there were""more planes than pilots. """,ontonotes5
"But Taiwan's pilots get limited time in the air, so there aren't enough qualified pilots.",ontonotes5
"Experts explain that Taiwan has limited airspace, and virtually no space for training.",ontonotes5

"Experts explain that Taiwan has limited airspace, and virtually no space for training.",ontonotes5
Alex Kao warns that currently both public commentators and the military's own research focus on the possibility that the first wave of warfare in the Taiwan Strait will be a missile attack.,ontonotes5
"Mainland China need not choose to use high-cost, limited-quantity guided missiles, but could instead use a large number of 360-km range rockets to first attack Taiwan's air fields from the Chinese coast, thereby paralyzing Taiwan's air superiority.",ontonotes5
"Then, their navy could ferry raiders to Taiwan in less than one hour.",ontonotes5
Kao recalls that Vietnamese land forces were used to infiltrate US air fields in Vietnam and neutralize American air superiority.,ontonotes5
"Particularly now that the Coastal Defense Law has been passed, and responsibility for coastal patrols will pass to the non-military Coast Guard Command, if Taiwan's military still operates under the traditional assumption of first establishing air and sea superiority followed by defense on land, this could give mainland China an opportunity to strike a death blow.",ontonotes5
Some people see in third-wave warfare an opportunity to seize a decisive advantage in the face of a future armed threat from mainland China.,ontonotes5
"To be sure, because of the domestic development of the electronics industry in Taiwan, the ROC has a certain advantage.",ontonotes5
This is a key area of development for the future in which Taiwan can rely on itself and need not be limited by what can be procured abroad.,ontonotes5
"In fact, the pro-active defense Taiwan is currently studying is a way of pursuing peace.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan will not provoke mainland China, nor be the first to resort to war.",ontonotes5
But nor can it allow the PRC to think that Taiwan is so weak that the PRC will be tempted to act rashly.,ontonotes5
"Pro-active defense is necessary for Taiwan, but the real goal of the Taiwan side is peace.",ontonotes5
"Perhaps militarily there's a standoff situation of mutual intimidation, but what Taiwan most hopes for is that the cross-strait problem can be peacefully resolved without deploying a single soldier.",ontonotes5
"The crisis sparked by PRC missile tests pushed the security of Taiwan to the top of the issue list, and the ticket of Lee Teng-hui and Lien Chan of the ruling Kuomintang, which promised stability, won the election with 54% of the vote.",ontonotes5
"But none of the five candidates is advocating Taiwan independence, and, among the three main contenders, there is a race for the center.",ontonotes5
All three have proposed ideas to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait:,ontonotes5
"Lien Chan has proposed a""Taiwan Strait zone of peace,""James Soong has advocated the signing of a peace treaty with the mainland, and Chen Shui-bian has announced that if elected he will not declare Taiwan independent nor seek to have the""two states formula""inserted in the constitution.",ontonotes5
"Taking advantage of the Chinese New Year, many Taiwan businessmen working in the PRC returned to Taiwan to spend the holiday with their families.",ontonotes5
"Just after the new year, the Mainland Affairs Council and several non-governmental groups co-sponsored a seminar on economic relations with mainland China.",ontonotes5
They invited a number of Taiwan businessmen who were among the earliest to invest in the PRC to come to the seminar and relate their experiences.,ontonotes5
Will the election affect willingness to invest in the PRC?,ontonotes5
"Most of the businessmen expressed optimism that after the entry of the PRC and Taiwan into the World Trade Organization later this year, relations between the two sides would steadily improve.",ontonotes5
Maintaining peaceful relations across the Taiwan Strait is the common hope of the vast majority of the people of Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"When you talk about 21st century leadership in Taiwan, cross-strait policy is the most serious subject that politicians must face, because it involves the very survival of Taiwan.",ontonotes5
""" However, because this subject touches on the question of the ' loyalty ' of the candidates toward Taiwan, it has become a terrifying topic for them,""says Wang Chien-chuang, president of The Journalist magazine and a longtime observer of political development in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"By looking at the carefully worded statements of the various candidates, he says, it is clear that they are all afraid of being accused of""selling out Taiwan. """,ontonotes5
"Unafraid of criticism that he is""betraying Taiwan,""he has publicly endorsed the PRC's policy of""one country, two systems. """,ontonotes5
"Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates Taiwan independence, produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy, which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position.",ontonotes5
"But, in an unguarded moment, Chen also declared""Long live Taiwan's independent sovereignty!""and this comment has left many people uncertain which is the real Chen.",ontonotes5
"James Soong has suggested defining Taiwan-PRC links as a""quasi-international relationship. """,ontonotes5
"This aims for a middle ground between the KMT's""two states formula""and the PRC's""one country, two systems""that will appeal to Taiwan, mainland China, and the international community.",ontonotes5
"But this idea has been criticized for unilaterally reducing Taiwan to the status of a""quasi-country,""thereby weakening Taiwan's status and bargaining power vis-a-vis the mainland.",ontonotes5
"Lien Chan, candidate of the ruling KMT, is somewhat bound to support the government's""two states formula. """,ontonotes5
"This is because over the past few years a consensus has taken shape in Taiwan society on policy toward mainland China:""Taiwan first. """,ontonotes5
"He adds,""Taiwan is a pluralistic society, and if you want to attract many types of voters, you can't be too outspoken about policy.",ontonotes5
""" There is a very curious aspect to Taiwan's electoral culture,""explains Wang.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan is small, and voters do not clearly distinguish between the roles of the head of state, elected legislators, and government bureaucrats.",ontonotes5
"That is why when Chen Shui-bian went to Sanhsia in Taipei County, he talked about a pension for the elderly, and when Lien Chan went to Kaohsiung he talked about establishing a science-based industrial park there.",ontonotes5
The issues that surround him can be traced back to his more than two decades near the top in Taiwan political life.,ontonotes5
"Kuo Shu-min of the China Times Express, a longtime observer of the KMT, says that controversy over James Soong goes back to the days when the KMT ruled over Taiwan and repressed all opposition.",ontonotes5
"Says Kuo,""If Lee Teng-hui is a Taiwanese opera performer, then James Soong is a Peking opera actor-Soong's moves are refined down to the last detail. """,ontonotes5
"During his five years as governor, he visited each of the 309 towns and rural townships in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
Compare Taiwan to the US.,ontonotes5
"He's been in government for more than 20 years, serving as minister of transportation and communications, foreign minister, Taiwan provincial governor, premier, and vice president.",ontonotes5
"Lien was born in Xi'an in mainland China, and his first primary school was called the Zuo Xiu school.",ontonotes5
"But in contemporary Taiwan, coincidentally, the characters zuo xiu mean""to put on a show""or""market yourself. """,ontonotes5
"Political writer Hsia Chen says that when Lien was foreign minister, he laid the foundations of pragmatic diplomacy, and allowed Kuo Wan-jung to attend the Asian Development Bank annual conference in Beijing.",ontonotes5
"He won the mayorship of the capital city of Taipei back in 1994, and, step by step, has become the most popular figure in the DPP.",ontonotes5
"As Taipei mayor, his decisiveness won many plaudits, but his manner was often perceived as overbearing and this led to frozen relations with the city council.",ontonotes5
"As Wang puts it:""Perhaps Chen would say that many problems in Taipei had reached a point calling for decisive action, but whether efficiency is more important than consultation is an eternally debatable question. """,ontonotes5
"On the question,""Does the candidate have a grasp of the key problems in education reform in Taiwan? """,ontonotes5
"Soong has taken into account the long-existing disparity between state-funded and private secondary schools in Taiwan -LRB- private schools are much more expensive, though they merely provide the same education as the state schools -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"This applies to economic relations with the PRC as well, Because wherever there are controls there will be speculation",ontonotes5
This applies to economic relations with the PRC as well.,ontonotes5
"Some believe that Taiwan's market is too affected by non-economic factors, so the government must play a protective role.",ontonotes5
There has long been debate in Taiwan over the relative importance of the market and government intervention.,ontonotes5
But it can not be overlooked that one major reason Taiwan is now the world's 12th largest trading nation is because government policy has fostered economic prosperity.,ontonotes5
"J.T. Day, chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the ROC, avers,""Taiwan needs to improve, but does not need to change. """,ontonotes5
Democratic reform in Taiwan in recent years has come about without the shedding of a single drop of blood; this is an amazing accomplishment.,ontonotes5
"Ten years ago, the total annual value of Taiwan's imports and exports was NT$ 50 billion.",ontonotes5
"Day asks:""If Taiwan were not a good business environment, why would big corporations bring their second generation back from abroad to take over?",ontonotes5
He argues that Taiwan was the country least affected by the Asian financial crisis because the government handled the situation well.,ontonotes5
Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics:,ontonotes5
"And third, whatever the outcome, this is the beginning of Taiwan's post-strongman era.",ontonotes5
"For example, sometimes he seems opposed to allowing PRC firms to invest in Taiwan, sometimes in favor; sometimes he seems against the opening of direct links with the mainland, sometimes not.",ontonotes5
"Lien must face up to the fact that his party has been governing in Taiwan for 50 years, and people want change.",ontonotes5
"Even if he wins, this may mean only that the people of Taiwan are willing to give Lien Chan a chance, and would not necessarily be an endorsement of the KMT itself.",ontonotes5
What kinds of challenges face the next leader of Taiwan?,ontonotes5
"The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime,""black gold politics""-LRB- the confluence of organized crime, moneyed interests, and corrupt politicians -RRB-, and raising economic competitiveness.",ontonotes5
The greatest variable for Taiwan society remains the other side of the Taiwan Strait.,ontonotes5
""" In the past two years, Taiwan has been continually testing where mainland China will draw the line in cross-strait relations,""says social critic Nan Fang Shuo.",ontonotes5
"The most important challenge for Taiwan now is to transcend the old mentalities of cold war anti-communism and Taiwan independence, and to build a new logic of peace.",ontonotes5
Taiwan's future is now in the hands of its voters.,ontonotes5
"In Taiwan's""quiet revolution""of democratization, the people have participated enthusiastically, but not irrationally.",ontonotes5
"In the middle of March, Taiwan will select the president who will lead the island into the new century.",ontonotes5
"But the election, besides affecting the future direction of the country, has another rarely mentioned dimension: Since the three major candidates Lien Chan, Chen Shui-bian, and James Soong are running roughly equal, this suggests that after the election there may be a restructuring of Taiwan's political party system.",ontonotes5
"The people of Taiwan are selecting not only their future leaders, but are choosing a new direction for party politics and democratic development.",ontonotes5
"What is it about the political environment that means that the election for the president of the ROC, which was not conceived as a presidential system, will affect the future development of the country?",ontonotes5
"In Taiwan in the year 2000, there are many challenges:",ontonotes5
"Although entry into the World Trade Organization will create a new situation in the Taiwan Strait, the two sides remain in an obscure relationship that is neither war nor peace.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan must come up with a comprehensive policy that considers economic, diplomatic, and military factors.",ontonotes5
"At the top, this election is a contest among Taiwan's second-generation political elites.",ontonotes5
"Underneath, it is a struggle among the various forces that currently exist in Taiwan's society.",ontonotes5
"Chen Shui-bian, the nominee of the Democratic Progressive Party, is the greatest hope for the opposition party as it seeks the first-ever transfer of power in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Soong's candidacy has opened up new fault lines in Taiwan's party politics, and has attracted the support of many NP legislators and other non-KMT and non-DPP forces.",ontonotes5
The ROC constitution was not originally designed as a presidential system.,ontonotes5
"Whether he wins or not, his candidacy signals a drastic change in Taiwan's party politics.",ontonotes5
"In fact, Taiwan's main parties-the KMT and the DPP as the two major parties, with the New Party as a noteworthy but limited third force-all understand the implications of James Soong's powerful candidacy very clearly.",ontonotes5
"If Chen Shui-bian is elected, this would be Taiwan's first case of a peaceful transfer of power from one party to another.",ontonotes5
"DPP legislator Chang Chun-hung says that the process of democratization in Taiwan during Lee Teng-hui's administration has been smooth and tranquil, but beneath the surface there lurks a major threat to democracy: the KMT's""black gold politics. """,ontonotes5
"Were Chen Shui-bian to win, though the DPP would take control of the executive branch, Taiwan's current two-major-plus-one-minor party structure would probably not change very much.",ontonotes5
"After an impressive start, the NP has faded steadily over the past few elections, and suffered an especially sharp blow in the election for mayor of Taipei two years ago.",ontonotes5
"But if Chen Shui-bian becomes president, because the DPP is seen as the party of Taiwan independence-the direct antithesis of the New Party-this could inspire NP members to pull together, and at the same time give the party the status and ability to absorb the forces that are backing James Soong.",ontonotes5
"KMT legislator Li Hsien-jen points out that the DPP retains advocacy of Taiwan independence in its party platform, and DPP vice-presidential candidate Annette Lu is well known for her support of Taiwan independence.",ontonotes5
But he does not see Taiwan independence as the main flashpoint.,ontonotes5
"If this happens, the New Party will no longer be in decline as it is now, but will re-emerge as a force to be reckoned with, and Taiwan will be looking at a true three-party system.",ontonotes5
"Shao Tsung-hai says frankly that, even if Soong himself does not lead the way, his supporters-faced with the reality of party politics in Taiwan-would have to organize in order to coordinate their operations.",ontonotes5
"Though it is impossible to say whether such a situation would be stable, for those who are dissatisfied with the current choices and who want a reshuffling of party politics in Taiwan, this is the opportunity to create a fresh climate.",ontonotes5
"Chang Chun-hung suggests that, in addition to uncertainty in party politics, a Soong victory could also bring instability to Taiwan's constitutional system.",ontonotes5
"With Soong as president, political elites in Taiwan would be, as Alexander Lu describes it, like a basketball team whose players have never played together before.",ontonotes5
"He says Taiwan voters should most be on the lookout for the""one of us""effect.",ontonotes5
This has long been a tactic used in Taiwan elections.,ontonotes5
"As a result, Taiwan's ethnic groups are pitted against one another politically.",ontonotes5
"Lin Wen-cheng states that in terms of daily life, differences between Taiwan's ethnic groups have largely disappeared.",ontonotes5
"In the last election for the mayor of Taipei, it was obvious that virtually all mainlanders voted for Ma Ying-jeou.",ontonotes5
"In the 2000 election, Taiwan will not only be choosing a new leader.",ontonotes5
"It will also be choosing a new direction for party politics, and will help decide future relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and between ethnic groups in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of""black gold politics ""?",ontonotes5
"This event, like the three preceding it, brings media professionals from countries with formal diplomatic ties with the ROC to Taiwan to receive training.",ontonotes5
Is this helpful in consolidating ROC diplomatic relations?,ontonotes5
"Activities include lectures on communications and broadcast theory, visits to domestic media, and activities to help the visitors understand the people and culture of Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Through these activities, the GIO hopes to give these citizens from the ROC's diplomatic-partner states both knowledge and warm hospitality.",ontonotes5
Most of those attending this year's course come from anglophone countries in the Caribbean Basin.,ontonotes5
"These include Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, and St. Kitts and Nevis -LRB- all eastern Caribbean islands -RRB- and Belize -LRB- on the Central American isthmus -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"During their stay in Taiwan, they are not only introduced to media elites in Taiwan and to the local media environment and facilities, but can also gain a greater knowledge of the land and people of the Republic of China.",ontonotes5
"This they can take home to share with their fellow citizens, thereby helping the ROC's diplomatic partners and their peoples to understand Taiwan better.",ontonotes5
Lecturers are mainly broadcasting and journalism experts from Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"Generally speaking, the participants are very interested in Taiwan's high-tech industries and products.",ontonotes5
Visits to the Kuanghua computer market have proven especially popular.,ontonotes5
The visitors are generally favorably impressed by the prosperity of Taipei City and by the consumer behavior of Taiwanese.,ontonotes5
"In a television interview, television news producer Marcus Bailey from Maitland TV of Grenada said that he has learned a great deal about the editing facilities and techniques used in Taiwan television, and that he would be able to apply this information in his own television production work when he returned home.",ontonotes5
He added that he would very much enjoy an opportunity to work together with colleagues from Taiwan television.,ontonotes5
"Unfortunately, it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned, because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
Most of the participants at the fourth Television News Seminar for Friendly Nations came from English-speaking Caribbean nations with which the ROC enjoys official relations.,ontonotes5
"The""Nine Dragon Lanterns ""-each striking a different pose-lend an imperial aura to the main gate of the CKS Memorial.",ontonotes5
"These may not have the flash of the large electrically lit lanterns found at the CKS Memorial, but the traditional handmade lanterns at the Lungshan Temple have an enduring beauty all their own.",ontonotes5
"Morris Chang, chairman of TSMC and a leading light of Taiwan's high-tech industry, is the hottest university lecturer around.",ontonotes5
"Two years ago, National Chiaotung University invited Chang, one of the Taiwan IT sector's most prominent success stories, to lecture to students in its MBA program for top managers, single-handedly raising awareness of executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs.",ontonotes5
The crush of business professionals fighting for a spot in the MBA program at Taiwan's most illustrious institution of higher education-National Taiwan University-ensured that the acceptance rate for the executive graduate school was even lower than that for undergraduates taking the national university entrance examinations.,ontonotes5
"Various indications demonstrate that the""back flow education""promoted by the Ministry of Education has become the hottest investment undertaking among Taiwan's universities.",ontonotes5
"Currently, around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan, including NTU, National Chiaotung University, National Sun Yat-sen University, Da-Yeh Institute of Technology, and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology, offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel.",ontonotes5
"Other management experts note that once Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization -LRB- WTO -RRB-, foreign universities will be able to recruit students directly in Taiwan, and that with the Ministry of Education asking national universities to come up with a portion of their own funding, universities are doubly motivated to establish programs of this sort.",ontonotes5
"NTU, which enjoys the distinction of being Taiwan's premier institution of higher education,""never lacks for students, because there are always people who want to attend NTU,""says Tang Ming-je.",ontonotes5
"Chang Chin-tsung, a researcher at the Chung-Shan Institute of Science & Technology with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from a US university, shuttles between his office in Taoyuan s Lungtan and the NTU campus three days each week.",ontonotes5
"Although Hsinchu's National Chiaotung University offers a similar management curriculum, he was concerned that the students there would be science park types with similar backgrounds in high tech fields.",ontonotes5
"Advanced training for professionals has become a hot topic among executives over the past two years, but continuing education is nothing new among Taiwan's universities.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, some become highway speeders, rushing from Taoyuan or Hsinchu to attend class.",ontonotes5
""" I have my time perfectly allotted,""says Morna Lee, Taiwan regional business manager for Kellogg's.",ontonotes5
"Still, sometimes nothing can be done, such as the time that she had a meeting in Hong Kong early one Friday morning, forcing her to miss class on Thursday while she flew to Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
She had to fly quickly back to Taipei to make class on Saturday afternoon.,ontonotes5
"Last year, one professor made a big hit with over 30 students, taking them to mainland China for over ten days to familiarize them with the investment environment there.",ontonotes5
"This year, trips are planned to Japan and Silicon Valley in the United States.",ontonotes5
"Judging from the manner in which universities are opening their doors for continuing education, non-degree programs, and professional training, higher education in Taiwan appears to be undergoing a sort of makeover.",ontonotes5
"Many scholars believe that with the EMBA phenomenon just getting off its feet in Taiwan, many corporate bosses are taking a""wait-and-see""attitude.",ontonotes5
"Perhaps business education may not be widespread in Taiwan at this time, yet a small number of company bosses have taken the lead themselves-taking advanced courses and setting an example for management personnel.",ontonotes5

"In Taiwan, the Acer Group's Aspire Academy opened its doors in Lungtan -LRB- Taoyuan Country -RRB- last October after three years of planning.",ontonotes5
"During the Aspire Academy opening ceremony, academy president Stan Shih, chairman of the Acer Group, remarked that he hopes to introduce management models from Europe and America and mesh them with the unique attributes of Taiwanese industry to enhance the globalization of Asian business.",ontonotes5
"At least the entrepreneurs, managers, and executives in campuses around Taiwan clearly recognize that learning is a necessity for survival and an engine of growth.",ontonotes5
This has especially been the case with Peipu -LRB- Hsinchu County -RRB- and Shihkang -LRB- Taichung County -RRB-.,ontonotes5
"Each is predominantly Hakka, each is located in north-central Taiwan, and each has about 10,000 inhabitants.",ontonotes5
the earthquake decimated Shihkang but left Peipu virtually unscathed.,ontonotes5
"The earthquake killed more people in Shihkang than any other township in Taiwan, and Shihkang remains largely in ruins a half year later.",ontonotes5
"Peipu, in the meantime, enjoys a booming tourist industry that just keeps growing.",ontonotes5
"Since the earthquake, Peipu's Ta Ai Community Affairs Center -LRB- TCAC -RRB- has lent sustained assistance to Shihkang in a remarkable display of how a disaster can bring out the best in people.",ontonotes5
""" Donations and volunteers came flooding in immediately after the earthquake,""says Shihkang mayor Hsieh Chen-ying,""but we all knew that it wouldn't last for long.",ontonotes5
"The city of Taipei""adopted""Shihkang after the earthquake, assigning personnel from its various ward offices to stay on long-term in Shihkang and assist with earthquake recovery.",ontonotes5
"Mighty Taipei, however, is joined in this task by Peipu's TCAC, which is among the few organizations that have provided continuous assistance ever since the quake.",ontonotes5
Peipu lends a helping hand,ontonotes5
"TCAC and the people of Peipu have only got so many resources. """,ontonotes5
"In the little community of Peipu, TCAC managed to collect three truckloads of relief supplies and over NT$ 400,000 after the earthquake.",ontonotes5
"In order to put it to the best possible use, they toured the disaster area several times and decided to devote all their energies to help the recovery effort in the township of Shihkang in Taichung County.",ontonotes5
"Besides their common ethnicity, the seriousness of the damage in Shihkang was a major reason why TCAC chose to concentrate on Shihkang.",ontonotes5
"Shihkang is located on the banks of the Tachia River, and was one of the areas most heavily hit by the quake, with 178 deaths, over 1,200 buildings totally destroyed, more than 500 homes partially destroyed, and dozens of historic old structures demolished.",ontonotes5
"TCAC had already been active in community development efforts in Peipu, and its members knew from this experience that rebuilding from the earthquake would take a long time, so they set up Shihkang Work Station at Tuniu Elementary School in late October and made plans to stay for a year.",ontonotes5
This newsletter has also helped to spur increased contact between the people of Peipu and Shihkang.,ontonotes5
"According to Li Chieh-ying, they distribute 3,000 copies of the Shihkang Newsletter in Shihkang, 500 in Tungshih and Shinshe, and 1,000 in Peipu, which enables the people of Peipu to truly get a feel for what is needed in the disaster area.",ontonotes5
"By sending a person to serve full-time at the Shihkang Work Station, TCAC has managed to quickly integrate itself into the local community in Shihkang, and to see where assistance is most urgently needed.",ontonotes5
"The children of Shihkang, for example, are in especially great need of psychological counseling, so TCAC asked the Hsiuh-li Liuh Memorial Foundation to provide therapy for children and teachers.",ontonotes5
"The Far Eastern group only donated 50 prefab units, and people in less than privileged situations -LRB- such as renters and those living in illegally constructed residences -RRB- were not even eligible to apply for them, so TCAC has been working hard to put up prefab units for the residents of Tzu-yun Lane.",ontonotes5
A non-Hakka in Peipu,ontonotes5
It all has to do with their experience with community activism in Peipu.,ontonotes5
"You won't find the name Ta Ai on a map of Hsinchu County, for it is an administrative division not of the ROC government, but of the famous Yimin Temple of northern Hsinchu.",ontonotes5
"The Ta Ai area encompasses the three townships of Peipu, Paoshan, and Omei.",ontonotes5
"Yimin Temple commands the allegiance of Hakka faithful in 15 different temple districts, of which the Ta Ai district is one.",ontonotes5
"Peipu Township lies immediately southwest of the town of Chutung, and is surrounded by mountains.",ontonotes5
"Located in the center of Peipu is Tzu-tien Temple, the town's main landmark, and the bustling streets that run past the temple offer the best shopping and eating in town.",ontonotes5
"Shu Shih-wei, the key mover and shaker at TCAC, was born to parents from the mainland and grew up in Kaohsiung.",ontonotes5
"Formerly a professor at Chung Yuan Christian University, he first came to Peipu ago to help a colleague study the local architecture.",ontonotes5
Shu's role in the project was to study the sociology of Peipu and gain a clear understanding of life in a small Hakka town.,ontonotes5
"Shu ended up staying on in Peipu after the project came to an end, and today he serves as director of TCAC.",ontonotes5
"After settling in Peipu, Shu gradually put down roots in the local community and made friends.",ontonotes5
"The TCAC Newsletter provided the people of Peipu with an opportunity to speak their minds on such issues as preservation of local streams, their love for their hometown, and various local affairs.",ontonotes5
"A young man wrote in the TCAC Newsletter,""I used to have a job in another town, and every time I came back to Peipu I would go straight to the noodle shop and wolf down a bowl of bantiao noodles even before stopping to say hello to my parents.",ontonotes5
"Peipu residents have taken part enthusiastically in recycling campaigns, flea markets, and post-harvest yam roasts, and events of this nature have even drawn participants from out of town.",ontonotes5
"According to Chiang Yi-sen, when TCAC organized a camping trip last year, participants from Chutung, Toufen, and elsewhere actually outnumbered the locals.",ontonotes5
"Most notably, the people of Peipu have begun to sense the value of what they've got in their community.",ontonotes5
The campaign to beautify Peipu's Hsia Street is an excellent case in point.,ontonotes5
"Seven years ago, in order to ease the problem of increasing traffic congestion, the township widened Hsia Street.",ontonotes5
"According to Chiang Yi-sen, whose store is located on Hsia Street, everybody used to congregate in the cool shade of the walkways in the summer.",ontonotes5
"Fortunately, the people of Peipu quickly realized their mistake.",ontonotes5
Last year TCAC applied to the Council for Cultural Affairs for authorization to carry out a campaign to beautify Hsia Street.,ontonotes5
The gaily lit Hsia Street seems almost to have returned to an earlier time.,ontonotes5
"It might be impossible for Hsia Street to ever be exactly the same as it once was, but the beautification campaign taught the people of Peipu the value of what they have.",ontonotes5
"When the town hall made plans to rip up the stone steps on the long pathway leading up the mountainside at Hsiuluan Park and replace them with imported stone, local citizens protested, asking the town hall to leave the steps as they were.",ontonotes5
"Shu Shih-wei points out that for an agricultural community like Peipu, streams are an indispensable resource.",ontonotes5
"Aquatic life on Taping River, however, is dwindling due to destruction of the surrounding environment and excessive gravel mining on the river bed.",ontonotes5
"Last April, over 50 people from the townships of Peipu and Omei organized the TCAC Taping River Preservation Team.",ontonotes5
"With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place, TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September.",ontonotes5
"After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance, TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies, establishing a newsletter, and building prefab shelters.",ontonotes5
"In working together on the recovery effort, the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties.",ontonotes5
"At a New Year's celebration in Peipu, Shihkang mayor Hsieh Chen-ying gave the people of Peipu a gift as a token of gratitude for their generous assistance, and when TCAC board members traveled to Shihkang to inspect the progress on the prefab shelters, they took advantage of the occasion to exchange views with local residents.",ontonotes5
"The prefab units that TCAC helped build at Tuniu Elementary School were completed on February 28th, and Li Chieh-ying reports that the Shihkang Work Station is now concentrating primarily on gaining a clear picture of what is needed to get people back to work.",ontonotes5
"He feels that the cooperative relationship and emotional ties that have been forged between Peipu and Shihkang ought to be kept alive, and he hopes that the people of Ta Ai will be able to share their know-how in community activism with other localities so that Taiwan can recover the vibrant communities that it lost in the earthquake.",ontonotes5
Peipu's Ta Ai Community Affairs Center built 11 prefab shelters at Tuniu Elementary School in Shihkang.,ontonotes5
Performers of traditional Hakka music came from both Peipu and Shihkang to celebrate the completion of the shelters.,ontonotes5
The sight of the river spilling over a newly created drop-off in the formerly flat riverbed at Shihkang Dam gives stunning testimony to the power of last year's earthquake.,ontonotes5
"In a perverse twist of fate, the terrible destruction wrought by the earthquake has left Shihkang with a lot of valuable new""tourist attractions. """,ontonotes5
"Located in the center of Peipu, Tzu-tien Temple is the town's main landmark and features a big open area that is excellent for holding various activities.",ontonotes5
"The people of Peipu have come to understand the value of their heritage, and have begun working to preserve old buildings.",ontonotes5

""" Virtually all the major men's fashion brands have been brought into Taiwan in the last five years,""say Justin Lin, editor-in-chief of Men's Uno, a well-known fashion magazine.",ontonotes5

The Wu Family of Taihsi,ontonotes5
No one would know more about that than the older generation in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"The changes of the past five decades have had a deep impact, for example, on the Wu family of Yunlin County.",ontonotes5
"So lend your attention, dear reader, as we recount the ups and downs of an average family from a quiet little backwater called Taihsi Township.",ontonotes5
"Wu Tsung-sheng and his older sister have come to meet me at the train station in Touliu, administrative seat of Yunlin County.",ontonotes5
""" Taihsi is a rather unusual place,""says Tsung-sheng, the family's oldest grandson and a doctoral candidate in sociology at Tunghai University in Taichung.",ontonotes5
""" When I read the studies that describe Taiwan as being so prosperous, I have to wonder how their descriptions could be so totally different from what our lives have been.",ontonotes5
"Probably most people don't realize, adds Tsung-sheng, that there are still places in Taiwan as backward as Taihsi.",ontonotes5
"When McDonald's stores in Taiwan were swamped last year during a giveaway of Hello Kitty dolls, lots of people thought they might be able to beat the crowds by hitting McDonald's in supposedly untrendy Taihsi, but they found the lines there every bit as long as in more urban locations.",ontonotes5
"The scenery grows increasingly rural as we move west through the townships of Huwei, Tuku, Paochung, and Tungshih.",ontonotes5
Less than half an hour after leaving the train station we get off the county highway and onto narrow Tungshih East Road.,ontonotes5
"When we reach our destination in rural Taihsi Township, a few dozen buildings of modern ferroconcrete construction line the road, and shops of every description occupy the ground floor of each one.",ontonotes5
"Wu Tsung-sheng's parents, who are pushing 60 years old, run a local bakery, and they greet us with the wide smiles and warm hospitality so typical of haikou -LRB- as the locals are accustomed to calling Taihsi and the surrounding townships near the coast in western Yunlin County -RRB-.",ontonotes5
The second indignity was the onerous taxes that were levied in the early years after Taiwan returned to Chinese rule.,ontonotes5
"Grandma Wu was close to 30 years old when the Kuomintang recovered Taiwan from Japan, but the event meant little to her, for she had never received any schooling.",ontonotes5
"All she remembers is that when the war ended, Taiwan was turned over to""them. """,ontonotes5
"Her main worry these days is her granddaughter in Taipei, who is in her 30s and still unmarried.",ontonotes5
"Her eldest son Wu Chien-lo recounts that after he graduated from sixth grade in 1954 his family was too poor to let him go any further in school, so at age 13 he took off with an older boy on the slow train for Taipei.",ontonotes5
"Buildings were going up everywhere in Taipei in the mid-1950s, and the city was bursting with opportunities.",ontonotes5
I didn't have what it took to think about a career in Taipei.,ontonotes5
After two years in Taipei he went back home just as the area was getting electric power for the first time.,ontonotes5
"Taiwan back then was one of the world s biggest producers of sugar cane, but the harvest was extremely difficult work, as Chien-lo is painfully aware.",ontonotes5
"To avoid competing with his brother, Jui-ting opened up his store over ten kilometers north in Mailiao Township.",ontonotes5
Who would have guessed he would one day become the biggest beverage wholesaler in the Mailiao area?,ontonotes5
"Having watched his older brothers succeed with their bakery businesses, the youngest brother Tsai Kuo-lung took up the same business in the neighboring township of Szuhu after finishing his military service.",ontonotes5
"We were worried that they might fall in with the wrong crowd after they got into junior high,""says Mrs. Wu, adding that Taihsi is well known for the fact that it has""lots of dust in the air, lots of yams, and lots of gangsters. """,ontonotes5
To keep their kids out of trouble they sent all four of them off to a well-known Catholic boarding school in Touliu as soon as they reached junior high.,ontonotes5
"The result has been a bit comical in at least one respect, for the eldest daughter was so strictly observant of the prohibition against speaking Taiwanese in school -LRB- a rule formerly enforced throughout Taiwan -RRB- that she doesn't even speak Taiwanese very well any more.",ontonotes5
"After graduating from National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei, she came back to Yunlin County several years ago to teach senior high school in Touliu, and now she makes people laugh every time she opens her mouth to speak her odd brand of Taiwanese.",ontonotes5
This long leash is all the more impressive in view of the fact that there is no chance that either of these sociology majors will ever be able to make a living near home -LRB- because there are no major universities or research institutions in Yunlin County -RRB-.,ontonotes5
We all started boarding school at age twelve and then went on to university in Taipei.,ontonotes5
Less than ten kilometers away in Mailiao stands the Formosa Plastic Group's sixth naphtha cracker complex.,ontonotes5
"Tsai Jui-ting points out that even though Formosa Plastics uses a lot of foreign laborers from southeast Asia, the complex has also hired a lot of local people, and since the plant went into operation he doesn't seem to see so many young people hanging out in the area's small towns with nothing to do.",ontonotes5
"What's more, he adds, there are no major hospitals in Yunlin County, so if you get sick you've got to go all the way to the next county.",ontonotes5
"When the subject turns to politics and Taiwan independence, the normally outspoken Wu Chien-lo suddenly grows cautious.",ontonotes5
"Yunlin County politics are riddled with factionalism and the influence of organized crime, and you can find ample proof here that all politics are indeed local.",ontonotes5
"Wu Tsung-sheng explains that local politics in the haikou area are linked only tenuously to what goes on in distant Taipei, and the concept of democracy hasn't made much headway here.",ontonotes5
"As Tsung-sheng drives down the road, holding forth on politics and society, I can't help feeling all of a sudden that there is every reason to be very confident about the future of Taiwan.",ontonotes5
Throw in the grandchildren and you've got four generations gathered at grandma Wu's traditional farmhouse right near the seacoast in Taihsi Township.,ontonotes5

"So declares Gennie Yen, the director of the ROC Office of the Palau Visitors Authority.",ontonotes5
"To be sure, since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the ROC and Palau last December 29, the island has received considerable media attention in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
The number of Taiwan visitors to Palau in January was double the number of last January.,ontonotes5
"In March, foreign minister Chen Chien-jen led a delegation to Palau which included government officials, private sector business people, and representatives of the mass media.",ontonotes5
"And in April, the Taipei office of the Palau Visitors Authority formally opened its doors.",ontonotes5
"This""Palau fever""has also infected Taiwan business people, who are always""susceptible""to new opportunities.",ontonotes5
"Building on the foundation of formal diplomatic relations, many Taiwanese firms are anxious to try their hand and to explore Palau's investment environment.",ontonotes5
"A guidebook describes this beautiful archipelago nation in the South Pacific as being""at the end of rainbows. """,ontonotes5
"Though this may seem far, far away, in fact, Palau is geographically the closest to Taiwan of all the countries with which the ROC has formal diplomatic ties.",ontonotes5
Jewels in the Pacific,ontonotes5
Taiwan and Palau share much more in common in terms of culture and historical position than most people realize.,ontonotes5
The people of Palau are of the same ethnic background as the aboriginal people of Taiwan-Malayo-Polynesian.,ontonotes5
"Last year when the inaugural Polynesian Cultural Festival was held in Taitung County, scholars and arts troupes from Palau were among the participants.",ontonotes5
"During the modern age of Western and Japanese colonialism, both Taiwan and Palau experienced foreign rule which has left traces of Spanish, Japanese, American, and other cultures.",ontonotes5

-LRB- Palau did not gain full independence until 1994. -RRB-,ontonotes5
Palau-Taiwan political contacts began in the 1980s.,ontonotes5
"In 1983, President Haruo I. Remeliik led the first Palauan delegation to Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"In 1984, the two countries signed an agricultural cooperation agreement, and Taiwan dispatched a technical assistance team there.",ontonotes5
"Since the beginning of exchanges between the two governments, Taiwanese business people have been conducting trade with Palau, and have also invested there, entering the restaurant, fishing, retail, and other trades.",ontonotes5
"During the Taiwan Strait missile crises in 1995 and 1996, when rumors and panic filled the air, fraudulent business groups in Taiwan cheated many investors with a scam surrounding real estate in Palau, but there was a silver lining to this cloud: It attracted the attention of more Taiwan business people, and especially the domestic tourism industry, to business opportunities in Palau.",ontonotes5
"Bin-fang Stone, now director of the Palau-ROC Friendship Association, was one of those who came to Palau at that time to explore the possibility of investment in real estate.",ontonotes5
"Stone states:""Before independence, there was a serious lack of tourist facilities in Palau.",ontonotes5
Most of the visitors were in specially-organized groups from the US or Japan which came for deep sea fishing or scuba diving.,ontonotes5
"It was only when Taiwan tourist agencies began developing the tourist route to Palau that many Taiwanese began to invest in the tourism industry here. """,ontonotes5
"Snorkeling, one of the most popular activities in Palau, was brought in by Taiwanese entrepreneurs, and you could say that they have been among the founders of the Palauan tourism industry.",ontonotes5
Currently there are more than 100 Taiwanese living in Palau.,ontonotes5
"Though most of the investments are small, there are large projects, including the Hotel Palau, opened in 1998 and built by the Kuomintang-run ACC Corporation development company, as well as a large vacation spa currently being built by the Hung Kuo Group.",ontonotes5
"In addition, Taiwan businessman Chen Liang-shen made a major investment by purchasing outright a local hotel.",ontonotes5
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau.,ontonotes5
"The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism, textiles, electronics, and fishing, who went to investigate the investment environment.",ontonotes5
"Taiwanese entrepreneurs already in Palau enthusiastically welcomed the establishment of an embassy there, which makes the future of their investments even more secure.",ontonotes5
"Lin Neng-jong, director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who visited the island in March, points to some special concerns in the Palau investment environment: For one thing, the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development.",ontonotes5
"In fact, Palau relies on""imports""for most of its labor as well, and there are 6000 foreign workers in the country.",ontonotes5
"Lin concludes:""Tourism is still the best investment in Palau right now. """,ontonotes5
"Early Taiwanese investors have certainly been proved perspicacious, since Palau's pollution-free environment is its greatest asset.",ontonotes5
Diving aficionados have hailed Palau as the greatest of the seven wonders of the deep.,ontonotes5
"Especially noteworthy is""Blue Corner,""one of the most famous snorkeling locations in the world.",ontonotes5
And it is not only the ocean that is beautiful; Palau's land scenery is also absorbing.,ontonotes5
"The""Rock Islands,""known as""a garden on the sea,""have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life, as well as amazing waterfalls.",ontonotes5
"The islands of Peleliu and Anguar, which were battlefields in the Pacific war between the US and Japan, are criss-crossed by tunnels built by the Japanese, while the remains of ships and aircraft dot the ocean floor.",ontonotes5
"In the air, because Palau is a tropical ocean climate, and rains leave as fast as they come, tourists are often treated to rainbows.",ontonotes5
"Gennie Yen, the director of the Taiwan office of the Palau Visitors Authority, says that people have even seen three rainbows at one time.",ontonotes5
Lin Neng-jong says there are two viable directions to get into the Palau tourism industry.,ontonotes5
"One is to invest in a tourism-related industry in Palau, the other is to increase the number of Taiwan tourists and extend profit opportunities into Taiwan itself.",ontonotes5
"Oddly, despite Palau's beauty, in the past few years tourism has dropped off considerably.",ontonotes5
"In 1997, there were more than 70,000 foreign visits to Palau.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan has been, along with Japan, one of the main sources of tourists to Palau.",ontonotes5
"As a result, Taiwan tourism businesses in Palau, which mainly cater to Taiwanese, are crying uncle.",ontonotes5
"Hsu Wen-sheng, deputy director-general of the ROC Tourism Bureau, says that a major reason why profit margins have shrunk is that tour operators in Taiwan no longer aggressively push Palau as a destination.",ontonotes5
"Hsu notes that Far East Airlines, which operates the Taiwan-to-Palau route, raised the price of a ticket by over NT$ 3000 two years ago, citing inadequate passenger demand and high costs.",ontonotes5
"This made Palau much less competitive compared to other places such as Guam, Bali, and Phuket.",ontonotes5
"James Yeh, general manager of the Sunrise Express Travel Service, which specializes in Pacific Island tours, says that the current trend among travelers in Taiwan is for low group fares with lots of entertainment provided.",ontonotes5
"Though Palau is rich in natural attractions, it lacks peripheral tourist facilities like pubs, shopping centers, and gift shops, so naturally the islands are less attractive.",ontonotes5
"Despite all this, James Yeh notes that the rate of return visitors to Palau is very high, more than 30%.",ontonotes5
"If the problems of high group rates and inadequate facilities can be solved, there is enormous potential yet in Palau.",ontonotes5
They are also studying a proposal from the Taiwan side to lower landing fees and reduce underlying ticket costs.,ontonotes5
"In addition, the PVA now has a Taiwan office, and hopes to raise Palau's profile among Taiwan travellers.",ontonotes5
"In the current wave of interest in investment in Palau, the fisheries industry is also getting attention.",ontonotes5
"Currently, there's only one Taiwanese business person in the fishing industry in Palau-Tai Jung-fei-so profits are quite good.",ontonotes5
"Koo Kuang-ming, chairman of Koo's Holdings Company Ltd., which operates fishing boats in the South Pacific, explains that South Pacific fishing is divided into two types-net fishing, and line fishing of tuna.",ontonotes5
"Palau is not really suited to the former, because its territorial waters are not large, so the catch is limited.",ontonotes5
"On the other hand, tuna stocks there are high, so Palau is more suited to line fishing.",ontonotes5
"In addition, though there are many varieties of fish around Palau, the scale of operations is small, and markets are far away, so the return on investment would not necessarily be very high.",ontonotes5
"Koo points instead to a different option: The waters around Palau are clear and warm, which makes them suited to aquaculture.",ontonotes5
"Koo cautions, however, that""if you want to invest, you have to go large-scale, because after all Palau is far from the main markets. """,ontonotes5
Palau Free Trade Zone,ontonotes5
"In 1986, Palau, like many former American-controlled trust territories, signed a""Compact of Free Association""with the US.",ontonotes5
"The agreement allows Palauan products to enter the States tax-free, and there are no quota limits for such things as textiles.",ontonotes5
"For Taiwan, a major producer of textiles and electronics, this is a very strong investment incentive.",ontonotes5
Currently Japanese and Taiwanese business people are negotiating with the Palauan government to establish a Palau Free Trade Zone.,ontonotes5
"The idea is for Palau to designate a special zone for economic development, with the Palau government providing tax and land-use incentives.",ontonotes5
"The zone would be for processing of exports, mainly in textiles and electronics, and mainly to the US market.",ontonotes5
"Felix Yen, president of the Zhen An Palau Corporation, which is handling the Hung Kuo project, is very familiar with the business climate in Palau.",ontonotes5
"But even leasing is a complicated matter, because traditionally land in Palau is owned jointly by the family and the clan.",ontonotes5
"Though the communications problems may be resolved within a few years-the government has received US assistance for priority construction of electricity and fiber optic facilities-Lin Neng-jong still cautions those interested in signing on to the free trade zone plan to""be prudent. """,ontonotes5
""" The point to watch out for in the whole plan is that Taiwan firms may not understand that it might not be all that good a deal from the point of view of the Palau authorities,""he says.",ontonotes5
""" The terms under which Palau would accept the proposed zone may not be as good as many Taiwan business people optimistically expect. """,ontonotes5
A careful look will show that Palau has many pearls.,ontonotes5
"Li Mao-tsung, a pottery expert living in the US, who was commissioned by the ROC government to do a study of the suitability of Palauan clays for pottery, says that Palau has a lot of clay of decent quality, making the islands a good location for the development of art pottery or large scale pottery and porcelain production.",ontonotes5
"Perhaps Palau is, as Gennie Yen says, like a just-opened oyster, with the pearl gleaming before your eyes.",ontonotes5
"But to grasp the pearl, Taiwan business people will have to rely on their wisdom and experience.",ontonotes5
"On March 24, just days after the ROC presidential election, the Council of Grand Justices made a constitutional interpretation of last year's National Assembly term extension, declaring the move null and void.",ontonotes5
"Finally, on April 24 these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of several constitutional revisions, including deactivation of the National Assembly, favorable provisions for residents of Taiwan's offshore islands -LRB- Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu -RRB- and military personnel, and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices.",ontonotes5
"This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan's constitutional structure, seeing as it is not a presidential system, a cabinet system, or a two-headed system in the true sense.",ontonotes5
"That said, despite landmark changes such as the full election of the national parliament in Taiwan and establishment of the legal groundwork for the direct election of the ROC president, the ROC Constitution has been revamped with alarming frequency over the past few years.",ontonotes5
"While the latest round of constitutional revisions satisfies the general desire across the political spectrum to progressively dismantle the National Assembly, sloppy accompanying provisions and the failure of the various political parties to propose a new blueprint in its place provide cause for new concern over the health of constitutional government in the ROC.",ontonotes5
"This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan's political parties expected when, attempting to align with public opinion, they moved to phase out the National Assembly.",ontonotes5
"Raised in a Hakka village in Miaoli County, Yeh Chu-lan, a graduate of the law department at Fu-Jen Catholic University, is the new Minister of Transportation and Communications, overseeing 120,000 employees and an annual budget of over NT$ 400 billion.",ontonotes5
"Since running for legislator in 1989, Yeh Chu-lan's approach to politics for over a decade has been to""do things for Taiwan. """,ontonotes5
"For a short period after graduating from university she returned to teach in Miaoli, but in order to be together with Cheng Nan-jung she returned north to look for work in Taipei.",ontonotes5

"Featuring aboriginal folk songs and a rendition of the ROC national anthem by pop queen Chang Hui-mei, the ceremony was attended by over 10,000 foreign guests, overseas Chinese, and local citizens.",ontonotes5
"Observers at home and around the world were waiting and wondering-would he address the""one China""issue?",ontonotes5
"In his 40-minute speech, Chen declared the determination of the people of Taiwan to carry out a peaceful transfer of power between political parties, and to continue forward with their democratic political system.",ontonotes5
"He called for a government for all the people and a non-partisan coalition of the forces opposed to corruption, and declared the new government's determination to improve law and order, the economy, the environment, post-earthquake reconstruction, and other aspects of life in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"On the subject of cross-strait relations, Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral, cultural, and historical background, and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future""one China. """,ontonotes5
"He also promised that during his presidency, as long as the Communist Party regime renounces the use of military force against Taiwan, he will: -LRB- 1 -RRB- not declare independence; -LRB- 2 -RRB- not change the nation's name; -LRB- 3 -RRB- not push for the inclusion of the""state-to-state""formula in the constitution; -LRB- 4 -RRB- not promote a referendum on Taiwan independence; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- not seek to abolish the National Reunification Council or the National Reunification Guidelines.",ontonotes5
"He stated that Taiwan would abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action.",ontonotes5
"He also indicated that the new government would request the Legislative Yuan to pass and ratify the International Bill of Rights as a domestic law of Taiwan, so that it would formally become the""Taiwan Bill of Rights. """,ontonotes5
"Later in the day, Taiwan's various political parties all released statements on the inaugural address.",ontonotes5
"NP convener Hau Lung-pin commended Chen for his finessing of the""one China""issue.",ontonotes5
Beijing responded almost immediately to Chen's speech.,ontonotes5
"While expressing dissatisfaction at his avoidance of the""one China""issue, they also stated that it might be possible to re-start cross-strait negotiations if Taiwan were willing to return to the one China formula adopted during talks in 1992, when it was agreed that each side could maintain its own interpretation of what""one China""means.",ontonotes5
"US President Bill Clinton praised Chen's speech as pragmatic and constructive, and stated his hope that the two sides would be able to resume dialogue at an early date.",ontonotes5
"Japan's Foreign Minister Yohei Kono also commented favorably, indicating his government's hope that the two sides can engage in dialogue and work for a peaceful resolution of the cross-strait issue now that the new president has taken office.",ontonotes5
"In addition to heads of state and representatives from countries with which Taiwan enjoys either formal diplomatic ties or friendly relations, the inaugural was also attended by three generations of democracy activists from mainland China -LRB- Lin Xiling, Wei Jingsheng, and Wang Dan -RRB- and Lech Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize winner and former president of Poland.",ontonotes5
"All these visitors complimented Chen Shui-bian for his speech and expressed support for Taiwan's determination to follow the path of democracy, freedom, and peace.",ontonotes5

And in New Jersey another democratic victory/.,ontonotes5

That is in New York City/.,ontonotes5
Mayor Michael Bloomberg the Associated Press projects will be re-elected as the mayor of New York City/.,ontonotes5
but democrats will celebrate those two state-wide victories Virginia of course the most significant/.,ontonotes5
Democrats will certainly make the case that the president's troubles are continuing in the state of Virginia/.,ontonotes5
I will say though Anderson I think the bigger national question out of the state of Virginia might be that this helps the current incumbant governor Mark Warner/.,ontonotes5
and later tonight when we go to California the gentleman named Schwartzeneggar who has about a hundred million dollars threw millions into his big successful effort at governor/.,ontonotes5
But can the democrats really crow about what's going on in Virginia and what's going in New Jersey/?,ontonotes5
um and they won uh and in Virginia particularly/.,ontonotes5
Virginia was one of the first southern states to go republican/.,ontonotes5
The polls close eleven o'clock eastern out in California/.,ontonotes5
And that of course would affect the republicans more because they are in power in Washington controlling the presidency and the Congress/.,ontonotes5
Whether they take it out on Governor Schwartzeneggar in California could be another test of that as well/.,ontonotes5
the election that mattered for next year has already happened that special election in the Ohio congressional district with Cincinatti a republican district/.,ontonotes5

There are so many people in Rwanda now they've taken over two-thirds of the national park/.,ontonotes5
And because of that Rwanda now faces a problem/.,ontonotes5
There's said to be eighty elephants in Akagera/.,ontonotes5
Hannah and his crew beat it to shore and to safety not realizing that in April the US embassy in Kigali had issued a warning to American tourists about a rogue elephant charging visitors/.,ontonotes5
Akagera National Park may not be all that it once was/.,ontonotes5
nor of course is Rwanda/.,ontonotes5
Before the break we went to Africa with renown wildlife advocate Jack Hannah director of the Columbus Zoo/.,ontonotes5
He took us to a region of Rwanda where those who survived the genocide of eleven years ago or ten and a half years ago are living side by side with wildlife/.,ontonotes5
Uh we were just talking about Rwanda/.,ontonotes5
Uh this last year in tourism increased sixty-seven percent in Rwanda/.,ontonotes5

Tom Forman CNN Washington/.,ontonotes5
and I hope we never have to use it in the United States/.,ontonotes5
And that means that the president of the United States or the vice president or the secretary of defense or the chief justice has to specifically authorize precisely the kind of extreme measures that are permitted to be used/.,ontonotes5
What the McCain amendment is just repeating is the Geneva convention standard that already applies in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
But then if it's felt necessary to use any of these measures short of torture water boarding extreme psychological measures if the president of the United States is prepared to put his credibility on the line and say the future of the nation is stake we must violate the law in this instance like we would if we had to shoot down a civilian airliner let the president take accountability/.,ontonotes5

I didn't say the United States military alone can't crush this insurgency/.,ontonotes5
Would it make any difference uh let me rephrase the question if the US had another hundred thousand troops in Iraq/?,ontonotes5
what we have to do is have the right number of troops in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
We have the right number of troops in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
"But I assume they think that if they keep this drum beat this deadly series of suicide bombings IED's improvised explosive devices, if they just keep killing a lot of individuals Americans and Iraqis, eventually the American public will get fed up and the US will pull out/.",ontonotes5
There's been discussion already as you well know of a quagmire emerging in Iraq/.,ontonotes5

Then we'll hear from a key US lawmaker who's questioning the strategy in Iraq democratic senator Karl Levin/.,ontonotes5
Plus Lebanese president Emile Lahoud talks about the political unrest in his country and what it could mean for the entire mid-east region/.,ontonotes5
Our web question of the week asks this should the US set a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq/?,ontonotes5
We return now to my interview with the commander of the US military central command general John Abizaid/.,ontonotes5
The Sunday Times of London has a piece today suggesting that there has emerged a dialog of discussions between US officials and Iraqi insurgents/.,ontonotes5
I'm not sure that I would characterize it as a dialog between US officials and insurgents/.,ontonotes5
I would say that US officials and Iraqi officials are looking for the right people in the Sunni community to talk to in order to insure that the Sunni Arab community becomes part of the political process/.,ontonotes5
and when we do that and they participate in a peaceful way I think Iraq will really start moving in a positive direction/.,ontonotes5
I sense that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi terrorist number one in Iraq still on the loose right now/.,ontonotes5
His network exists inside Iraq/.,ontonotes5
It's got facilitation nodes in Syria/.,ontonotes5
It brings foreign fighters in from Saudi Arabia and North Africa/.,ontonotes5
It is connected to what is happening in Afghanistan and what is happening in Pakistan/.,ontonotes5
Do you agree with the CIA assessment and a recent assessment that the terrorist training ground of Iraq today effectively has become a more effective training ground for Al-Queda and for international terrorists than Afghanistan under the Taliban ever was/?,ontonotes5
they are certainly fighting in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
I would tell you if you're a young Saudi that decides to volunteer for the Jihad and you come into Iraq the chances are extremely good that you'll never come back from Iraq/.,ontonotes5
the place where terrorism really can get established is in places that are ungoverned spaces that are like between the Afghanistan Pakistan border area in the horn of Africa down in parts of the Arabian principle/.,ontonotes5
and we should not kid ourselves that Iraq somehow or other has made a difference/.,ontonotes5
Iraq is part of the battle/.,ontonotes5
The most recent CNN USA Today Gallup poll uh showed that the numbers have gone down to thirty nine percent favor the war in Iraq compared to seventy one percent shortly after major combat operations were over/.,ontonotes5
That's a disturbing element I assume for you as far as the demoralization of the US military/.,ontonotes5
the only thing I can tell you Wolf is when I go to the field the soldiers are uniformly confident about their ability to face this enemy make Iraq Afghanistan whatever area they happen to be operating in better defeat the terrorist wherever they find them and they all understand it's going to take time/.,ontonotes5
now you're command of central command has the whole middle east/.,ontonotes5
uh the new president elected of Iran he's considered a hard liner/.,ontonotes5
what if anything from the military's perspective does this mean for the United States/?,ontonotes5
Iran's an important player in the overall scheme of the Middle East/.,ontonotes5
We need to have them working towards stability in both Afghanistan and Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Then is it time for US troops to leave Iraq/?,ontonotes5
Iran's president-elect says Iran does not need the United States to help it become more self-reliant/.,ontonotes5
The US has criticized Iran's recent election as a sham/.,ontonotes5
Five suspects held in the disappearance of Alabaman teen Natalie Halloway are inside an Aruba Courtroom this hour/.,ontonotes5
I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington/.,ontonotes5
Joining us now from New York the top democrat on the Senate Arms Services Committee Karl Levit of Michigan/.,ontonotes5
You just heard General Abizaid say that the US military is now at what he said mile twenty one in a marathon/.,ontonotes5
As far as dealing with the insurgency in Iraq there are twenty six point two miles in a marathon/.,ontonotes5
Uh he said that there's an increased number of Jihadist coming across the border into Iraq to fight/.,ontonotes5
just the way going into Iraq was rose colored/.,ontonotes5
But you will acknowledge that General Abizaid at least this morning here on Late Edition seemed to get close to what the vice president is saying when he said the US is at mile twenty one in a twenty six mile marathon/.,ontonotes5
I think that the problem here that we've had right from the beginning is overly optimistic predictions on the part of what would happen if we attacked Iraq/.,ontonotes5
You heard General Abizaid also express concern about the morale if you will of the US men and women in Iraq and elsewhere/.,ontonotes5
How do you as a concerned critic of the policy of the war in Iraq deal with that kind of uh situation/?,ontonotes5
"and as far as I'm concerned the critics are determined that this time it's not going to be like Vietnam, this time as long as our men and women are there everything we possibly can do to support them is going to be done including realistic thinking and constructive criticism/.",ontonotes5
On the Karl Rove controversy that erupted this week the deputy white house chief of staff said this in New York/.,ontonotes5
Up next political winds of change in Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
"With his term set to expire last November, Syria demanded and the Lebanese parliament approved a constitutional amendment extending his presidency till two thousand seven/.",ontonotes5
The opposition movement headed by son Saud won a majority in parliament in the elections and is now poised to lead Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
Today we are facing a new era in the life of Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
With the blame focused on Damascus and pro-Syrian Lebanese officials opposition leaders have now called on President Lahoud to resign/.,ontonotes5
And just a short while ago I spoke with president Lahoud from the presidential palace in Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
You're seen as a close ally of Syria/.,ontonotes5
In the aftermath of the Lebanese elections are you inclined to move Lebanon away from that close alliance with Syria/?,ontonotes5
At first I 'd like to say that there are historic links between Syria and Lebanon that has been a long time/.,ontonotes5
And if you look at the of Lebanon you see that uh we have the sea and we have Syria on most of our borders and uh in the south we have Israel/.,ontonotes5
So we have to be on very good terms with Syria and continue to do that/.,ontonotes5
Mr. President uh there have been a series of assassinations though in Lebanon including the former prime minister/.,ontonotes5
Well I can tell you that the ones that did this abominable assassination uh against late prime minister are the enemies of Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
And they want to do harm to Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
"For sure it's not Lebanon nor Syria because until the assassination everything was fine, the stability and security were at its best according to Interpol who are number one on the list of security in the world/.",ontonotes5
So it couldn't be Syria nor Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
It must be the enemies of Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
We said because they were trying to unstable Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
listen to what the spokesman at the White House the press secretary Scott McClellan said on June tenth/.,ontonotes5
I can tell you that Syria is the most that is losing uh because of these assassinations/.,ontonotes5
and at the time Israel was accused/.,ontonotes5
They're trying to accuse Lebanon and Syria/.,ontonotes5
A lot of observers of Lebanon blame Syria's interference in Lebanese politics over the years most recently getting the parliament to extend your term of office for another term for another three years as being responsible for this current wave of anti-Syrian attitudes reflected in the elections that have occured over these past few weeks/.,ontonotes5
He was referring to the possibility that Syrian intelligence agents are still operating inside Lebanon even though the Syrian military has withdrawn/.,ontonotes5
Have Syrian intelligence operatives left Lebanon/?,ontonotes5
Well I can tell you this uh matter eh eh for Lebanese the Hezbollah the majority of Lebanese consider it as a national resistance because they freed Lebanon of Israel/.,ontonotes5
"All I can tell you that still Lebanon is at war, it's not at peace/.",ontonotes5
one of them is the presentation of the Palestinians who are in Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
And this is a very grave problem for Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
Lebanese consider in their constitution that there will not be any of the Palestinians nor there will be any partition of Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
there are people who are against Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
should the US set a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq/?,ontonotes5
Still ahead on Late Edition an exclusive interview with Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari about his visit with President Bush and the huge challenges still facing his country. Plus my conversations with two of Washington's most influential politicians the Vice President Dick Cheney and Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy/.,ontonotes5

Just a short while ago I spoke with Iraq's national security adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie about the political and security challenges still facing his country the upcoming trial of Saddam Hussein and much more/.,ontonotes5
Mowaffak al-Rubaie thanks very much for joining us from Baghdad/.,ontonotes5
You're referring to the Iraqi Sunnis The minority uh in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
and if we want to get the referendum uh uh and our people to ratify uh our draft of constitution in the next referendum we need to include every part of Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Will Islam be the official religion of the state and the source of all law in Iraq/?,ontonotes5
What do you say to those who might fear though that Iraq a Shia dominated Iraq with Islam the official religion could turn out to be like its neighbor Iran/?,ontonotes5
And to form and establish uh uh a democratic a liberal uh system in Iraq no community should dominate/.,ontonotes5
As you know there are a hundred thirty nine thousand or so US troops in Iraq right now/.,ontonotes5
General George Casey the US military commander on the ground in Iraq suggested earlier in the week that perhaps that number could be significantly reduced beginning in the spring/.,ontonotes5
And a considerable number uh of the multinational forces will probably leave Iraq uh by before the end of next year/.,ontonotes5
How many Iraqi troops and police forces are fully capable of operating right now without US or multinational coalition assistance/?,ontonotes5
But of that two hundred thousand plus how many of them are fully capable right now to operate without US assistance/?,ontonotes5
but uh I know your prime minister Ibrahim al Jaafari is working on a multipoint plan to deal with life in Iraq right now/.,ontonotes5
"uh also it incorporates securing Baghdad as the capital of Iraq and also increasing the uh protection of the infrastructure uh uh formation of target oriented special forces uh uh also increasing the intelligence activity because you know this is a intelligence uh led war, this is not a traditional classical war/.",ontonotes5
and good luck to all the people of Iraq/.,ontonotes5
"And just ahead is a timetable set, should one be set, for US troops to start leaving Iraq/?",ontonotes5
We'll ask two key United States senators about that and more/.,ontonotes5
And later Egypt trying to recover from a deadly terrorist strike/.,ontonotes5
Our web question of the week asks this should religion play a role in Iraq's new constitution/?,ontonotes5
they're standing by to weigh in on where things stand in Iraq the war on terror and much more/.,ontonotes5
US Army General George Casey the head of coalition forces in Iraq talking this past week about the possible start of US troop withdrawals next year/.,ontonotes5
In his home state of Arizona Republican Senator Jon Kyl/.,ontonotes5
And here in Washington Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut/.,ontonotes5
Is it realistic to assume that tens of thousands of US troops might be able to get out of Iraq by next summer/?,ontonotes5
People like Senator Kyl and I who've supported uh the war in Iraq uh know how important victory is/.,ontonotes5
and we've got to be very careful that we don't just declare victory but we achieve victory that we don't uh give encouragement frankly to those who have been pressing us to set a deadline for getting out of Iraq/.,ontonotes5
You can only get out of Iraq when we achieve the mission/.,ontonotes5
Senator Kyl there's one argument that's being made that the Iraqis would be better off with a much smaller US military footprint there/.,ontonotes5
the US doesn't have enough troops to really get the job done/.,ontonotes5
a bunch of us in Congress worry that the Army that we have today is not big enough and we're stressing it and the people in it sending people back to Iraq two three times/.,ontonotes5
we'll get to that subject uh on another occasion the overall strength of the US military/.,ontonotes5
Is the US prepared for similar kinds of strikes that we have seen in recent days in London two series uh of attacks there as well as Sharm-el-Sheikh in Egypt/?,ontonotes5
The first answer is we can never assure uh the people in America that they are totally protected from that kind of attack/.,ontonotes5
That means uh a very good intelligence capability both abroad and in the United States/.,ontonotes5
But have you seen Senator Kyl a dramatic improvement in intelligence gathering human intelligence infiltrating these cells over the past few years on the part of the United States/?,ontonotes5
We have gone uh since nine eleven without an attack here in the United States/.,ontonotes5
Yet Senator Lieberman there are still widespread reports that the US doesn't have enough human assets spies that are penetrating some of these cells some of these al Qaeda related organizations doesn't have enough native speakers in Arabic or other languages part of these groups/.,ontonotes5
I don't think anybody on Capitol Hill or in the administration is satisfied/.,ontonotes5
Look what did the terrorist attacks in London and Egypt in the last couple of week tell us/?,ontonotes5
And the United States has been a target and surely will be again/.,ontonotes5
A lot of the law enforcement authorities especially in New York City the police commissioner the mayor saying they're not going to get involved in ethnic or racial or religious profiling whatsoever in dealing with potential threats to the trains the subways the buses/.,ontonotes5
If we have a profile of some kind of killer in this society and frankly there's {a} rapist on the loose in Arizona right now and there is a picture that's been drawn by police uh artists of what this guy looks like. And anybody that has an appearance somewhat like him should expect to be profiled by the police here/.,ontonotes5
we're at a point where I'm glad that the New York subway system is beginning to randomly search people getting out of the subways/.,ontonotes5
Up next though a quick check of what's in the news right now including some late breaking developments in the London terror investigation/.,ontonotes5
Hello I'm Frederika Whitfield at the CNN center in Atlanta/.,ontonotes5
And now in the news we have some new developments to tell you about in the London terror investigation/.,ontonotes5
And in southern England police have arrested six more suspects in the July twenty-first incident/.,ontonotes5
In Iraq there is no let up in the violence/.,ontonotes5
four US troops were killed last night by a road side bomb near Baghdad's airport/.,ontonotes5
I'm Frederika Whitfield in Atanta/.,ontonotes5
I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington/.,ontonotes5
We're continuing our conversation with Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Republican Senator John Kyl of Arizona/.,ontonotes5
Senator Lieberman is it a good idea for the President to give uh John Bolton what's called a recess appointment skirting the US Senate as the next US ambassador to the UN/?,ontonotes5
He'll have the obvious uh authority of the President of the United States/.,ontonotes5
he would be Senator Kyl the first United States ambassador to the United Nations who did not get confirmation from the United States Senate/.,ontonotes5
Senator Lieberman uh based on what you know right now are you inclined to vote to uh confirm John Roberts as the next US associate justice of the Supreme Court/?,ontonotes5
but is the future of the US shuttle program in jeopardy/?,ontonotes5
Still Discovery's mission the first US manned space trip since the Columbia shuttle explosion in two thousand three is being extended by one day/.,ontonotes5
Just a short while ago I spoke with shuttle program deputy manager Wayne Hale from the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas/.,ontonotes5
So I guess the key question on everyone's mind right now are those astronauts uh in danger upon their return to Earth/?,ontonotes5
"Returning from Earth orbit, traveling twenty-five thousand uh feet per second seventeen thousand miles an hour, coming to a complete dead stop at a runway in Florida that is a hazardous operation/.",ontonotes5
And don't forget our Web question of the week should religion play a role in Iraq's new constitution/.,ontonotes5
There's much more ahead on Late Edition including Egypt's prime minister Akmed Alze the pressure for political reform inside his own country and much more/.,ontonotes5
Then a successful reign in terror in Great Britian/.,ontonotes5

it was about somebody in the CIA who was an analyst who got her husband this job to go to Africa to see if they could find evidence of wh-/-,ontonotes5
Yeah sure but you know you know ah welcome to ah Washington and politics/.,ontonotes5
I wanted to ask you about Scott McClellan who as you know has been just uh eviscerated by reporters at the White House this week/.,ontonotes5
it's what somebody would do who was a Soviet spy or a spy in the Kremlin for us/.,ontonotes5
After terrorist target London how's the rest of the world winning the war on terror/?,ontonotes5
Speculation about the cheif justice of the United States got out of control this past week/.,ontonotes5
Police are facing more rowdy behavior as New Orleans ' nightlife makes a comeback/.,ontonotes5
New Orleans police have already lost their superintendent been accused of looting and seen two colleagues take their own lives during Katrina stress that surfaced when this officer grabbed a producer from Associated Press television who caught the arrest on tape/.,ontonotes5
Before we talk to the New Orleans police let me say we are getting late breaking word from the attorney uh for the man on that tape now saying his client was not even drinking that night/.,ontonotes5
Captain Marlon Defillo spokesman for the New Orleans police department joins me uh now by phone/.,ontonotes5
And let me also add that you know there's not a police department in America that's not having personnel problems/.,ontonotes5
Eddie Jordan Jr. is the New Orleans district attorney/.,ontonotes5
here's some of what we've seen from New Orleans police since hurricane Katrina/.,ontonotes5
"Victoria Habathee if you were asked to testify in some sort of proceeding be it a pre-trial hearing be it a trial be it to provide uh general thoughts on the psychological conditions of some of these officers knowing what you know about what happened in New Orleans, is it fair for some of them to say everything that happened the amount of hours we were working the fact that we've been away from our families etcetera from the psychological point of view does that explain what we see on the video tape/?",ontonotes5
the city of New York was not destroyed/.,ontonotes5
but I think the men and women in New Orleans police department on the whole are coping with it as best they can/.,ontonotes5
Last week police found the body of Virginia college student Taylor Biehl/.,ontonotes5
And Richmond police also looking for another teenage girl Monica Sharp went out for a walk with her dog weeks ago/.,ontonotes5
Her remains were found last Thursday in Matthews County Virgina about seventy miles from Richmond/.,ontonotes5
Now to another uh case another missing Richmond Virginia girl Monica Sharp last seen leaving her house to walk her dog at around ten thirty am on September eighteenth/.,ontonotes5
apparently he had an Illinois driver's license but does not necessarily reside there/.,ontonotes5
I think that they were seen together in Richmond um either Monday or Tuesday/.,ontonotes5
and I think Monday or Tuesday she was seen in Richmond with him/.,ontonotes5
"Coming up, some senators want to know what White House advisor Karl Rove told this man to make him so comfortable with Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers even though many of his allies are not/.",ontonotes5
Now their families are suing a Minnesota county where he was charged with a different crime/.,ontonotes5
Our search this week is in California/.,ontonotes5
Did the White House provide assurances to some conservatives about her beliefs on hot button topics like abortion/?,ontonotes5
Amid the devastation after Saturday's powerful earthquake in Pakistan some dramatic rescues/.,ontonotes5
Officials estimate as many as thirty thousand were killed in Pakistan alone and several hundred in India/.,ontonotes5
The US is promising at least fifty million dollars in aid/.,ontonotes5
and Pakistan is accepting aid from rival India/.,ontonotes5
President Bush is in New Orleans to get an update on progress following hurricanes Katrina and Rita/.,ontonotes5
He dined Monday night with Louisiana officials in the French quarter and is staying in a hotel there/.,ontonotes5
Thousands of people in Colorado are without power after a major snowstorm/.,ontonotes5
and as someone that's been very involved in this process of judicial selection and someone's worked with the White House I had no assurances given/.,ontonotes5
I can't imagine uh that uh Karl Rove or anyone else at the White House gave information/.,ontonotes5
If those assurances are good enough for James Dobson then all of America ought to hear them/.,ontonotes5
No what we're talking about actually is whether information was given from the White House to/-,ontonotes5
and just days later Dylan's remains discovered in the Montana woods/.,ontonotes5
Well now Brenda Groney and Mark McKenzie's families are preparing a lawsuit claiming a judge prosecutors and law enforcement authorities in Becker County Minnesota are responsible for letting Duncan out on bail when they should have known he was a violent sex offender and they should have known he 'd likely offend again/.,ontonotes5
March of this year Duncan's charged with molesting two boys in Minnesota/.,ontonotes5
He was already a registered sex offender having served almost two decades for the violent rape of a fourteen year old boy in Washington state/.,ontonotes5
and on May fifteenth Brenda and Slade Groney and Mark McKenzie were murdered in Idaho/.,ontonotes5
In addition to my fury at Duncan I became furious at all the finger pointing in Minnesota/.,ontonotes5
But the bottom line is the law in Minnesota allowed for bail/.,ontonotes5
The law in Minnesota needs to be changed/.,ontonotes5
Well you know in our system of justice in the United States things can be changed/.,ontonotes5
but this is the kind of case that can change the law or change how sex offenders are treated in the United States/.,ontonotes5
and in uh Minnesota they need to take care of it now/.,ontonotes5
and you think it's fair then to say that you blame the Minnesota authorities for everything that happened here/?,ontonotes5
but you're also saying that the county in Minnesota is responsible for these deaths/.,ontonotes5
This week we're focusing on California/.,ontonotes5
Coming up the terror alert in New York City now over/.,ontonotes5
Some of you come to the defense of New York officials criticized for going public about questionable threats/.,ontonotes5
Many of you writing in about the terror threats on the New York City subway system and fact that New york was taking it more seriously than the feds/.,ontonotes5
Homeland security ie FEMA condemned the mayor of New Orleans/.,ontonotes5
and now Homeland Security's condemning the Mayor of New York for overreacting/.,ontonotes5
Jeff Morris in Socrates New York/.,ontonotes5
The source for this latest is saying Jihadists from Iraq are coming to NYC for an attack on the subway system/.,ontonotes5
If this is true doesn't this contradict that we are now safer for invading Iraq rhetoric the White House has been saying for a long time now/?,ontonotes5
PJ Williamson from Tennessee/.,ontonotes5
I trust the local officials much more than the Washington jokers/.,ontonotes5
Finally Sherry Sharrows from Belleville Illinois/.,ontonotes5
War in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
And I don't think he would have passed muster at the Memphis meeting we were covering because he was so culturally conservative/.,ontonotes5
This was just a day after Littlejohn spoke out for the first time telling WCBS in New York that police have got the wrong guy/.,ontonotes5
Well at about two fifteen this afternoon in a packed ceremonial courtroom in Brooklyn court with Imette's sister and mother sitting in the front row and dozens of reporters watching Mr. Littlejohn walked in/.,ontonotes5
Earlier in the day Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Brooklyn District Attorney Joe Hines laid out some of the evidence in the case in addition Dan to what we 'd heard before Which was the cops had cell phone records placing Mr. Littlejohn in the area where Imette's body was found Witnesses saying that Mr. Littlejohn left the Falls bar with Imette And blood of Mr. Littlejohn's apparently on the ties that were binding together Imette's hands/.,ontonotes5
but in the state of New York you're not allowed to simply tell the authorities something that's not true and send them going elsewhere/.,ontonotes5
She put two and two together heard eh different comments and conversations. And then all of a sudden spotted my son and this teacher in Ocala and then called me and uh asked if I knew my son was in Ocala which um you know it was a normal summer day. I thought he was at the rec center which is a place that he's always been/.,ontonotes5
And in Afghanistan a man faces possible execution for converting to Christianity in violation of Islamic law/.,ontonotes5

The body of a fourth colleague American Tom Fox was found dumped in Baghdad two weeks ago/.,ontonotes5
Girl goes missing in Pittsburgh when she's fourteen/.,ontonotes5
If she had been a prisoner in any way shape or form I'm sure the Allegheny County police would have charged him with those charges/.,ontonotes5
And uh frankly from the time she was eighteen that's an adult in this state of Pennsylvania she could have walked away done anything she wanted to do/.,ontonotes5
"Coming up, a man faces a death sentence in Afghanistan after he admits he's converted to Christianity/.",ontonotes5
Abdul Rahman says he became a Christian fifteen years ago and was living in Germany before going back to Afghanistan in two thousand two in part to try and get custody of his two daughters/.,ontonotes5
But in the Afghan capital of Kabul it's Islamic values that count/.,ontonotes5
This is humiliating for Islam/.,ontonotes5
He helped uh develop Afghanistan's constitution and judicial system/.,ontonotes5
In Afghanistan there is a power struggle going on between those who want to bring the country back into the community of nations and make it modern and democratic country and the Islamic conservatives who have really run the country uh for the last decade/.,ontonotes5
And Afghanistan really represents something that's happening in the broader Islamic world which is a tension between democratic values on one hand and Islamic values on the other hand/.,ontonotes5
The state shall abide by the UN charter international treaties international conventions that Afghanistan has signed and the universal declaration of human rights/.,ontonotes5
It is hard to believe right uh as outsiders uh that this is a country that uh has been liberated by the United States uh that there are still many US troops there fighting the Taliban et cetera and somehow uh we now have to negotiate the right of citizens there to practice Christianity/.,ontonotes5
We could have worked over the last four years I believe much harder to make sure that Afghanistan had a competent non-ideological and non-political judiciary/.,ontonotes5
Our search is in New Mexico/.,ontonotes5

NBC's David Gregory is at the White House/.,ontonotes5
Everybody up there in New York understands that as well that he can push the US agenda/.,ontonotes5
Republican Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee which held the nomination hearings on John Bolton/.,ontonotes5
so the majority of the United States Senate supported ending the debate/.,ontonotes5
Let's listen to Senator and former Majority leader Trent Lott of Mississippi the United States senator from that state/.,ontonotes5
And they've been reeling from the child prostitution in Africa from the sexual harassment of top UN personnel/.,ontonotes5
Uh hopefully get a John Bolton who can force the Chinese and Zimbabwe and Sudan to understand that we have got to get rid of the odious Human Rights Commission/.,ontonotes5
Do you think there's a value in itself in having someone to go up there and just waste the place I mean in other words just give tough speeches try to humiliate them uh try to get them out and get them straightened out by just making fun of them by basically trashing some of those Third World members that have contributed to this uh horror in some of these cases you mentioned/?,ontonotes5
Do you worry about him rattling the cage of uh the head of North Korea with comments like he's a tyrannical dictator/?,ontonotes5
No I'm talking about the head of North Korea/.,ontonotes5
you just jumped on me because I quoted him saying it would be all right if they lost the top ten floors of the UN/.,ontonotes5
The UN is not going to dictate American foreign policy and how America defends itself/.,ontonotes5
"Did it bother you that when he filled out that questionnaire uh uh before your Senate Foreign Relations Committee your committee that he failed to note, in fact he denied, that he had been interviewed as part of the uh uh inspector general's investigation of the initial causes for the war in Iraq/?",ontonotes5
I 'd like to change it because I don't think the US can be the world's sole peacekeeper and world's sole humanitarian providers/.,ontonotes5
Thank you very much Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota a perfect guest for Hardball/.,ontonotes5
This president has more disdain for the United States Congress than any president I've seen in my thirty years there/.,ontonotes5
President Clinton's recess appointments included James Hormel an openly gay man Republicans opposed to be ambassador to Luxembourg and Judge Roger Gregory/.,ontonotes5
For President Bush recess appointments have gone to conservative Judges Charles Pickering and William Pryor Labor Department Solicitor Eugene Scalia the son of Justice Antonin Scalia and Undersecretary of State Otto Reich a key figure in the Reagan administration's policies toward Nicaragua/.,ontonotes5
The Secretariat Building in New York has thirty-eight stories/.,ontonotes5
It needs a strong voice from the United States to help reform this vital institution and make it uh relevant and meaningful and powerful for the time that we find ourselves in/.,ontonotes5
John Bolton is now the first US ambassador to the UN to be named through a recess appointment/.,ontonotes5
The question is will there be any fallout at the UN or any repercussions here in Washington when the White House and the Senate have to deal with each other again later this fall/?,ontonotes5
I'm David Shuster for Hardball in Washington/.,ontonotes5
And then there was Daniel Patrick Moynihan who went over there and took on the Third World on issues like uh the issues of anti-Israel sort of rhetoric over there and he won those battles/.,ontonotes5
And he can't go in with a mandate that the president has given him to shake the place up with some of those pungent sound bites and get along with enough people especially because his own credibility was really on the line on some of the tough issues that he's going to confront Iran Iraq North Korea/.,ontonotes5
He was very successful in a previous incarnation in New York when he was able to defeat the Zionism is racism uh resolution there back then/.,ontonotes5
Sure but Kofi Annan look doesn't have a whole lot of strength himself especially with critics here in the United States/.,ontonotes5
So while he would like to warn John Bolton as he did today that there are a hundred ninety other representatives the US has a certain special clout/.,ontonotes5
Do you think there's any danger in the world of causing a real war in North Korea again another Korean war by calling the North Korean dictator what he is/?,ontonotes5
What Rice is proving as secretary is that she's much more pragmatic as secretary of state than she was a national security adviser on Iran and on North Korea/.,ontonotes5
I'm joined right now by Steve McMahon Democratic political strategist and longtime adviser to Democratic Party Chairman Howard Dean I didn't know he's been around that long and Ben Ginsberg a Republican attorney and adviser to the conservative group Progress For America and also a man whose card has been stamped by working hard to win the president's recount in Florida right/?,ontonotes5
Doesn't it seem to you that people like John Bolton and John Roberts uh the uh Supreme Court nominee have all earned their spurs through this sort of red badge of courage down in the Florida recount/?,ontonotes5
I think in Florida we recruited the best and the brightest and people who we knew would be excellent in really a tough and historical setting and that's where those guys came in/.,ontonotes5
I mean obviously you know when you lead a nation and a world into war um eh and you have the kind of record that John Bolton has in spite of the fact that he went to Florida and fought in the recount I think you know the Democrats got smart/.,ontonotes5
Ben I have a sense this president wants this guy John Bolton to go up to New York/.,ontonotes5
He has the support of the president of the United States the secretary of state a majority of the United States Senate/.,ontonotes5
He's basically going to waste the other side the Third World people and just blow them up every night/.,ontonotes5
His mandate and goal is to fulfill the foreign policy of the United States/.,ontonotes5
and that absolutely includes helping the people of the Third World/.,ontonotes5
Ben Ginsberg will the United States Senate eventually confirm this guy to a full appointment/.,ontonotes5
Will this end up in a simple report uh from Patrick Fitzgerald the investigator the prosecutor from Chicago/.,ontonotes5
but there is it seems a lot going on beneath the surface and certainly a lot of speculation uh going on in Washington/.,ontonotes5
Joe Wilson says that Karl Rove will be frog-walked out of the White House/.,ontonotes5
"And having watched what this fellow uh Patrick Fitzgerald did in Chicago a week ago with the Daley administration where he took down the two top guys on patronage which most people would say isn't that what they do out there in Chicago, I think he's serious business/.",ontonotes5
You say John Bolton will be confirmed by the United States Senate within a year/?,ontonotes5
Uh next a delegation of conservative this is so hot radio talk show hosts from around the country went to Iraq to oppose what they call the liberal media bias against that war/.,ontonotes5
What's really going on in Iraq/?,ontonotes5
We're going to hear from a radio talk show host who was there and an Iraq war veteran/.,ontonotes5
"Coming up, conservative radio talk show hosts say the media is missing the story in Iraq/.",ontonotes5
Melanie Morgan is a radio talk show from San Francisco's KSFL AM five seventy/.,ontonotes5
She recently returned from Iraq with a half dozen other conservative radio talk show hosts where they broadcast for a week in order to combat what she calls the mainstream media and liberals ' attempt to undermine the war effort with negative news/.,ontonotes5
He's a veteran of the Iraq war and founder of Operation Truth dot org the nation's first and largest advocacy group for Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans/.,ontonotes5
Well first of all it was a hundred and twenty-five degrees in the shade in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Um and when you're wearing like I was twenty-five pounds of body armor um and sweating through your clothes and trying to stay hydrated um in the middle of a sandstorm um where we were trapped on a couple of different occasions it was pretty grueling tough work and an assignment that made me have a tremendous appreciation of what our troops are going through on a day to day basis in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
And that's something that I learned and reported on while I was in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
And I was there for a year in Central Baghdad/.,ontonotes5
And I think reporters need to really continue to go outside their area of comfortability outside the Green Zone/.,ontonotes5
what makes you assume that I stayed inside the green zone/?,ontonotes5
I was in Bejing when college students were being murdered/.,ontonotes5
I have been to Beirut in nineteen eighty three/.,ontonotes5
and this goes beyond Iraq/.,ontonotes5
And when I got to Baghdad at the outset we couldn't provide overwhelming force to establish security/.,ontonotes5
We're back with radio talk show host Melanie Morgan and Iraq war veteren Paul Rieckhoff/.,ontonotes5
Melanie how do we get the straight scoop on what's happening in Iraq because people tell me there's only two ways to go over there as a journalist I think your experience confirms this you either go over there and stay in the green zone or that part uh uh which is very secure and it's basically a compound or you go out with a unit as uh basically part of the unit an embedded reporter/.,ontonotes5
and I went outside of the green zone unlike uh Mr. Rieckhoff has accused me of doing/.,ontonotes5
I think that as an American people the stories that I tell from Iraq and that our fellow talk show hosts told um eh uh hopefully will engender a little bit more patience and endurance by the American people/.,ontonotes5
And I think Ms. Morgan is really insulting all the troops who've been there to assume that by going for ten days and taking a few casual leisurely trips outside the Green Zone that she got a full taste of combat/.,ontonotes5
And if reporters really want to do some investigative reporting they can fly into Jordan and go unembedded/.,ontonotes5
We stuck a microphone and let them talk directly to the people of the United States/.,ontonotes5
What I want to say is that we took our microphones to the US troops/.,ontonotes5
Now all of this violence has been located in an area known as the Euphrates river valley/.,ontonotes5
This is the main smuggling route for insurgents from the Syrian border into central Iraq/.,ontonotes5
An Iraq war vet who called President Bush a chickenhawk and worse lost his bid to become a US congressman from Ohio last night/.,ontonotes5
Tuesday night in an Ohio district President Bush carried by thirty points it was a victory for Rebuplican anti-abortion advocate Jean Schmidt/.,ontonotes5
The central issue was Iraq/.,ontonotes5
First of all voters now appear to be more receptive to criticism of the administration's approach to Iraq and skeptical of blanket support like Schmidt's/.,ontonotes5
We know that we're on the right track in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
One analyst says that if the fourteen marines from Ohio killed today had been ambushed last week the election results might have been reversed/.,ontonotes5
I'm running because uh I actually want to go to Washington and fight for regular Americans/.,ontonotes5
The question is was the anti-war sentiment in Ohio's second congressional district a national bell weather signalling things to come/?,ontonotes5
I'm David Shuster for Hardball in Washington/.,ontonotes5
Joining me now is the winner of yesterday's Ohio election Republican Congresswoman-elect Jean Schmidt/.,ontonotes5
Well well he did that with the national media eh when he was trying to paint himself in the Cincinnati based market/.,ontonotes5
If you looked at his ad he aligned himself with the president because he caught on rather quick uh when he won the uh primary election and he had gone on a radio station and said uh that the worst threat to the United States was not Osama bin Laden but the President that uh people didn't like that/.,ontonotes5
But uh with any short election and a very special election cycle I caution anybody to use this as a bell weather uh for uh where the Republican party is going in Ohio because uh very unique elections make outcomes uh very very different/.,ontonotes5
but the people right here in southern Ohio are talking about issues that affect them/.,ontonotes5
Do you think that the loss uh of the twenty uh guys over there servicemen fighting for their country over in Iraq for their Ohio based unit is going to bring this war home to people/?,ontonotes5
And that's for Matt Moppin the only missing soldier in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Uh the people in Ohio are very smart/.,ontonotes5
Uh they want to talk about national issues including Iraq but also border patrol and border security/.,ontonotes5
Congratulations to a member of the United States House of Representatives as soon as she's sworn in/.,ontonotes5
When we come back what does the narrow Republican victory in Ohio mean for the President/?,ontonotes5
More on that congressional race in Ohio and what it means for the rest of the country/.,ontonotes5
We're joined right now by Ohio Democratic congressman Sherrod Brown and Ohio's Republican Secretary of State Ken Blackwell who's also a candidate for governor who is in fact a candidate for governor/.,ontonotes5
But what happened in southwest Ohio Secretary Blackwell's right/.,ontonotes5
But the message clearly is that the ethical problems in Columbus the ties of this candidate that barely squeaked through this election when George Bush carried that district two to one and the former congressman carried it almost three to one the ties she had to Secretary Blackwell to Governor Taft to President Bush/-,ontonotes5
What does that mean in Ohio/?,ontonotes5
Do you think those are appropriate terms to refer to the President of the United States with/?,ontonotes5
Considering he was in Iraq he didn't think the war was a good idea to begin with/.,ontonotes5
Mr. Secretary are you happy as a candidate for governor of Ohio with the way this war in Iraq has been fought by the United States/?,ontonotes5
Uh Marines are from the state of Ohio/.,ontonotes5
What has happened in the state of Ohio is that Bob Taft has increased spending and he has in fact raised taxes/.,ontonotes5
It is Bill Berger who excuse me is the president of the Ohio uh AFL-CIO/.,ontonotes5
And I think the first step to getting towards the bottom of the scandal in Columbus is to have guys like Bill Berger resign/.,ontonotes5
Ken Blackwell Secretary of State of Ohio and US congressman Sherrod Brown of Ohio/.,ontonotes5
When we come back for the Washington Post Mike Gowan will be here to tell us about his visit to Gitmo/.,ontonotes5
He's just been to Guantanamo/.,ontonotes5
With several Republican senators pushing to regulate the military's treatment of detainees the Pentagon has launched a major PR offensive and is inviting US congressmen to spend a day touring the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay/.,ontonotes5
Washington Post reporter Mike Gowan visited Gitmo with a congressional delegation this Monday and is writing about the experience for tomorrow's paper/.,ontonotes5
What is it like down in Guantanamo for our guys watching those prisoners and interrogating them/?,ontonotes5
They spent six hours on the ground at Gitmo/.,ontonotes5
Each of the guides pointed out to us the black uh arrows that you see everywhere are showing where Mecca is/.,ontonotes5
Doesn't want an Abu Ghraib on his hands/.,ontonotes5
Fourteen US marines were killed when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb near Haditha in western Iraq/.,ontonotes5
All fourteen marines were from the same reserve unit based near Cleveland Ohio/.,ontonotes5
Another six marines from that same unit were killed in an ambush in Haditha on Monday/.,ontonotes5
That's after she reportedly showed up at a yoga class near her estate north of New York City/.,ontonotes5
Congressman Steven Lynch of Massachusetts is a member of the committee and is now with us from Boston/.,ontonotes5
I know that Tom Davis uh a Republican from Virginia and Henry Waxman from California have the Clean Sports Act that we're trying to get put through Congress/.,ontonotes5
Thank you very much Congressman Steven Lynch Democrat of Massachusetts/.,ontonotes5
Fourteen American troops were killed today in Iraq when a roadside bomb ripped through their lightly armored vehicle/.,ontonotes5
And earlier today President Bush again rejected calls for a timetable for withdrawal of US troops from Iraq/.,ontonotes5
The violence in recent days in Iraq is a grim reminder of the enemies we face/.,ontonotes5
These terrorists and insurgents will use brutal tactics because they're trying to shake the will of the United States of America/.,ontonotes5
Because everywhere in Washington we're hearing that although there's not a timetable set that we are beginning to be pull out our troops come next spring after the elections over there/.,ontonotes5
And if they don't we can't have an indefinite American presence in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
But what's interesting is this guy Paul Hackett who was on this show last week used the most amazing language in describing the President of the United States/.,ontonotes5
It doesn't look like a liberal senator from New York/.,ontonotes5
Ed Rogers do you think Hillary Clinton could take uh the beefier uh industrial states where the men have votes and guns and tend to like traditional women like Michigan like Illinois like Pennsylvania/?,ontonotes5
Bob the same people that vote for John Dingle in Michigan do you think are going to vote for Hillary Clinton/?,ontonotes5
From NBC news in Washington this is Meet the Press with Jim Russert/.,ontonotes5
Our issues this Sunday the war in Iraq tensions with Iran and the future of this woman our guest the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice/.,ontonotes5
But first as we begin the fourth year of the war in Iraq we are joined by the Secretary of State/.,ontonotes5
Very disturbing headlines in the papers yesterday the Russians helping Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Russian officials collected intelligence on US troop movements and attack plans from inside the American military command leading the two thousand and three invasion of Iraq and passed that information on to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein according to a US military study/.,ontonotes5
The intelligence report which the study said were provided to Hussein through the Russian ambassador in Baghdad during the height of the US assault warned accurately that American formations intended to bypass Iraqi cities on their thrust towards Baghdad/.,ontonotes5
The reports provided some specific numbers on US troop units ' locations according to Iraqi documents dated March and April oh three and later captured by the United States/.,ontonotes5
But these are US documents a US report/.,ontonotes5
When we first went into Iraq we had some unexpected encounters with Fedayeen/.,ontonotes5
Why won't the Russians help us get sanctions in the United Nations against Iran and try to stop them from developing nuclear weapons/?,ontonotes5
Uh what we're doing now is uh we're seeking a presidential statement that would make clear to Iran the international community's determination that it live up to the obligations that everyone thinks Iran has/.,ontonotes5
The Russians do not want a nuclear weapon in Iran either/.,ontonotes5
It's been very clear in everything that they have tried to do in the way that they set up the civil nuclear cooporation with Bushehr in what they offered the Iranians that the Russians also do not believe that there should be enrichment and reprocessing capability on Iranian soil/.,ontonotes5
Um we're considering whether it might be a good idea to um after we have a presidential statement uh get ministers together again uh with the the P five the permanent five of the Security Council plus Germany uh to talk about charting a course forward because everybody takes very seriously Iran's intransigence and Iran's unwillingness uh to do what the international community is uh determined that it will do/.,ontonotes5
It is the policy of our government that Iran will not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon/.,ontonotes5
Tim Iran can not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon/.,ontonotes5
That is the view of the international community not just the United States/.,ontonotes5
The reality is that most of us think the Iranians are probably going to get a weapon or the technology to make one sooner or later an administration official acknowledged a few weeks ago refusing to talk on the record because such an admission amounts to a concession that dragging Iran in front of the United Nations Security Council may prove an exercise in futility/.,ontonotes5
Uh if the international community stays really solid here Iran can not stand the kind of isolation from the international community that for instance North Korea endures almost by choice/.,ontonotes5
That's why we need our people in New York to really work toward this first phase/.,ontonotes5
That's why it was very important to get this uh Iranian dossier to the Security Council and why the diplomacy that we've been working over the last uh couple of years to get the Europeans and the United States on the same page and to now bring the Russians and the Chinese along uh has been so important/.,ontonotes5
do you believe if the President chose to embark on military action with Iran he would go to Congress for authorization first/?,ontonotes5
Let me turn back to Iraq/.,ontonotes5
US troops killed two thousand three hundred and sixteen. Wounded injured seventeen thousand two hundred seventy-one/.,ontonotes5
We're in Iraq because the um United States of America faces a different kind of enemy and a different kind of war/.,ontonotes5
And we have to have a different kind of Middle East if we're ever going to resolve the problems of an ideology of hatred that was so great that people flew airplanes into buildings/.,ontonotes5
Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a threat/.,ontonotes5
We faced um the outcome of an ideology of hatred throughout the Middle East that had to be dealt with/.,ontonotes5
Saddam Hussein was a part of that old Middle East/.,ontonotes5
The new Iraq will be a part of a new Middle East/.,ontonotes5
But Madame Secretary weapons of mass destruction was the primary rationale given to go into Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Saddam Hussein's last foreign minister Naji Sabri paid spy for +French intelligence later turned him over to the CIA to supply information about Iraq its chemical biological nuclear weapon program more than six months before the war began in March of oh three according {to} former intelligence officials/.,ontonotes5
But the point is that now that he's gone Iraq has an opportunity to be a different Iraq in a different kind of Middle East/.,ontonotes5
But I would ask people uh to look at the perspective here of what is really going on in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
That's extraordinary in Iraq's history where they've always settled their differences by violence not by politics/.,ontonotes5
And when they succeed in that uh they are going to have the basis for a very uh different kind of Iraq/.,ontonotes5
That it would not take hundreds of thousands of American troops to occupy Iraq/.,ontonotes5
These people are doing something that is quite unknown in the Middle East/.,ontonotes5
You have Syrian forces out of Lebanon/.,ontonotes5
You have uh Saddam Hussein out of uh Iraq/.,ontonotes5
The people of the Middle East are taking on authoritarian governments across the Middle East/.,ontonotes5
Kuwait has given women the right to vote/.,ontonotes5
"But the notion that somehow there was a placid Middle East, that if we just left it alone, if we 'd just not invaded Iraq, if we had just not overthrown dictators, if we {had?} just not challenged Syrian power in Lebanon everything would be just fine uh is simply not true/.",ontonotes5
It was that Middle East the malignancy of the Middle East that we quote unquote disturbed that led directly to the September eleventh event/.,ontonotes5
The President said this week that whether there'll be troops in Iraq for the unforeseeable future will be determined by the next president meaning we're going to have troops in Iraq at least through January of oh nine/.,ontonotes5
Let me turn to Afghanistan/.,ontonotes5
but America has stood solidly for religious freedom uh as the bedrock uh of uh democracy/.,ontonotes5
Should American Christian missionaries be encouraged to go to Afghanistan/?,ontonotes5
and your own state department report on human rights abuses eh says that Christianity is punishable by death that Christian missionaries are not welcome that women can not get a passport or leave the country without permission of a man/.,ontonotes5
But when something arises uh as with Mister Rahman it is the obligation of the international community and the United States and there has been support across Europe for this that the Afghans be reminded that in their own constitution they have enshrined the universal declaration on human rights which guarantees certain religious freedoms/.,ontonotes5
People should be able to convert to Christianity in Afghanistan/.,ontonotes5
and uh I very much think that the the best job in America's got to be NFL commisioner/.,ontonotes5
I still think the best job in America may be NFL commisioner/.,ontonotes5
We've got a great vice president of the United States in uh Vice President Cheney/.,ontonotes5
"Coming next, David Broder Elisabeth Bumiller Charlie Cook John Harwood interpret the Washington political landscape tackle the issue of immigration and look at the midterm elections in two thousand six/.",ontonotes5
Look at these scenes and these pictures from Los Angeles/.,ontonotes5
Five hundred thousand people according to police estimates turned out to protest some of the immigration reforms that are being discussed debated perhaps legislated in Washington/.,ontonotes5
It started as a border issue in uh states that have common boundaries with Mexico particularly/.,ontonotes5
Talking to Republican Governor of Minnesota it's a big issue in his state/.,ontonotes5
Suburban Illinois districts now find large Hispanic populations/.,ontonotes5
in the early days of this debate in two thousand four he was giving very emotional speeches about America the land of immigrants/.,ontonotes5
You know in two thousand Florida Florida Florida/.,ontonotes5
Two thousand four Ohio Ohio Ohio/.,ontonotes5
and you look at states like New Mexico and Arizona and Colorado some real potential swing states/.,ontonotes5
This was raised in the Virginia governor's race last year by the republican candidate who went after some of these job centers that attract illegal immigrants/.,ontonotes5
Let me turn to Iraq the big discussion in our country about Iraq the way the issue is being covered by the media/.,ontonotes5
There's a constant sort of perception if you will that is created because what's newsworthy is the car bomb in Baghdad it's not all the work that went on that day in fifteen other provinces in terms of making progress towards rebuilding Iraq/.,ontonotes5
The terrorists seem to recognize that they're losing in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
And then this Wednesday President Bush went to a town meeting in West Virginia of his supporters/.,ontonotes5
Does that issue work that it's the mainstream media that's distorting the good news that's coming out of Iraq/?,ontonotes5
Um I mean I mean getting out there and looking around wandering around Iraq looking for good news sounds to me like a good way to get killed/.,ontonotes5
but I have noticed this past week Scott McClellan saying the White House Press Secretary you know we're not blaming the media for the war in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
The conflict over the Dubai Ports World brought to the surface deep-seated resentments from the Capitol end of Pennsylvania Avenue toward the people around the President and surprisingly toward Bush himself/.,ontonotes5
Congressman Tom Davis of Virginia a committee chairman told The Post this is probably the worst administration ever in getting Congress ' opinion on anything/.,ontonotes5
and uh the bottom line is is this going to help with the war in Iraq/?,ontonotes5
United States headed in the right direction twenty-six percent/.,ontonotes5
Democrats need to win in Tennessee where Bill Frist is retiring have to run the table by defeating all the most vulnerable Republicans while holding all of their own seats including in Minnesota where their incumbent is retiring and in Washington state where Senator Maria Cantwell faces a very strong challenger/.,ontonotes5
They also need to hang on to somewhat more secure open seats in Maryland and Vermont as well as fourteen other incumbents/.,ontonotes5
Uh vulnerable senators Conrad Burns in Montana Lincoln Chafee Rhode Island Mike DeWine Ohio Santorum in Pennsylvania Jim Talent Missouri and the Tennessee seat/.,ontonotes5
But when you get to the fifth and sixth seats you get to winning in Ohio and talking about the Tennessee open seat/.,ontonotes5
Winning the war in Iraq is the top priority/.,ontonotes5
or do they have to come forward with a specific proposal to deal with these problems including Iraq/?,ontonotes5
And the great void on the Democratic side is nobody can tell you today what their policy is about Iraq about entitlements or about any of the other challenges facing the country/.,ontonotes5
Elisabeth Afghanistan a very thorny issue for this president uh who is uh very open about his Christianity/.,ontonotes5
and now we have the situation where it appears this gentleman who converted to Christianity in Afghanistan has been spared the death penalty/.,ontonotes5
But it's an ongoing issue as Secretary Rice seemed to indicate as that democracy in Afghanistan goes through some serious growing pains dealing with religious rights women's rights civil rights human rights/.,ontonotes5
This was also going on in Afghanistan/.,ontonotes5
Um it would be interesting to know what was going on behind the scenes and what kind of pressure was put on Afghanistan our good ally/.,ontonotes5
Charlie Cook politically will that be enough to deal with people's anxieties concerns about Iraq/?,ontonotes5
I mean your NBC Wall Street Journal polls show that Iraq was just a wet blanket over the administration/.,ontonotes5
I'm from Shreveport Louisianna/.,ontonotes5
Shreveport/.,ontonotes5
Iraq immigration flag burn the supreme court ruling against the President's claim of war time power/.,ontonotes5
With us the Assistant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell republican of Kentucky And the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chuck Schummer of New York/.,ontonotes5
In a major rebuke this week to the White house the Supreme Court ruled that the White House has to abide by the Geneva convention and the uniform code of military justice when handling detainees uh And ruled that the military tribunals can not be the/.,ontonotes5
Senator McConnell in addition to this the New York Times editors wrote in reaction to the Supreme Court's decision striking down the military tribunal set up to private detainees being held in Guantanamo bay it is far more than a narrow ruling on the issue of military courts. It is an important and welcome reaffirmation That even in times of war the law is what the constitution the statuette books and the Geneva convention say it is. Not what the President wants it to be/.,ontonotes5
Nor did it require the president to close Guantanamo/.,ontonotes5
Well let's break it down here Because this ruling does indicate to some human rights groups that this applies to the prisoners in secret CIA prisons to the prisoners in Afghanistan Beyond Guantanamo/.,ontonotes5
Senator McConnell should Guantanamo now just be closed/?,ontonotes5
That is not how the United States works/.,ontonotes5
Representative Peter King a Republican of New York said If there is another terror attack the blood will be on their hands Meaning on the editors and reporters of The New York Times and elsewhere/.,ontonotes5
We're at war with a bunch of people who want to hurt the United States of America/.,ontonotes5
And for people to leak that program and for a newspaper to publish it does great harm to the United States of America/.,ontonotes5
But it's part of America/.,ontonotes5
And as a founding father said when they first wrote the Constitution true to this day that's a good thing for America/.,ontonotes5
because Treasury Secretary Snow took a group of reporters on a trip to Afghanistan and other parts of the world to show off how they were tracking terror financing/.,ontonotes5
When it comes to difficult situations and clearly Iraq now is one And uh this administration has a penchant for diversion and scapegoating/.,ontonotes5
And here's the good news the good news for America and I think the good news in many ways/.,ontonotes5
They're going to have to solve the problem in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
They're going to have to solve the problem in the war on terrorism where Afghanistan is deteriorating right now/.,ontonotes5
Let's talk about real solutions Senator Because Democrats are sharply divided over Iraq/.,ontonotes5
By the Constitution and everything else is in charge of Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Now we did present an alternative The one that a vast majority of Democrats voted for including some who voted for the other one which said it was drafted by Senator Levin and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island/.,ontonotes5
And the fact the United States Senate doesn't get it shouldn't surprise you/.,ontonotes5
How do you go to the people in November when Democrats don't have an agreed upon policy in Iraq/?,ontonotes5
All of the debates in the Congress this resolution that resolution are going to pale in significance before how things are going in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
American success in Iraq showed that armchair generals and New York Times reporters were wrong in their assessments of how difficult the war would be/.,ontonotes5
rebuilding Iraq will be much easier than rebuilding Afghanistan he said Because Iraq has a well educated population and the oil to finance reconstruction/.,ontonotes5
Iraq has the potential to be a jewel in the Middle East/.,ontonotes5
Well certainly uh the taking of Iraq went as expected/.,ontonotes5
We've invaded Afghanistan Invaded Iraq/.,ontonotes5
But these are the same kinds of people who attacked us here in the United States/.,ontonotes5
And we've gone after these people Somewhere else Fighting them in places like Kabul and Baghdad so we don't have to have them again in Washington and New York/.,ontonotes5
Senator Schumer as you well know in Connecticut your colleague and friend and former vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman has a heated primary race on his hands against anti-war candidate Ned Lamont/.,ontonotes5
Joe Lieberman on the Iraq war/.,ontonotes5
We are now at a point where the war in Iraq is a war of necessity/.,ontonotes5
But if it talks like George W Bush and acts like George W Bush it's certainly not a Connecticut Democrat/.,ontonotes5
Okay as Campaign Chairman will you now today commit to supporting whoever wins that Democratic primary in Connecticut where he is now facing that uh tough challenge/?,ontonotes5
If you look at every poll who do the American people have more faith in in terms of Iraq/?,ontonotes5
Do they want to see a change in direction in Iraq/?,ontonotes5
Speaking of debates and rivalries Roll Call Newspaper reports Senator Schumer that you and your fellow New York senator Hillary Clinton have such an intense rivalry that this week you and Harry Reid your Democratic leader rather tried to exclude her from a news conference to announce one of her pet issues/.,ontonotes5
If she announces that she's running for president will you do what is customary and support your fellow New York senator for president of the United States/?,ontonotes5
Hillary Clinton is running for the Senate of the United States of New York/.,ontonotes5
And she is focused on New York/.,ontonotes5
And here we have a Long Island congressman happens to be named King who's saying treason and put these reporters in jail/.,ontonotes5
The people who killed three thousand Americans on September eleven who murdered Danny Pearl my colleague at The Wall Street Journal commit atrocities every day in Iraq are evil/.,ontonotes5
September twenty-fourth two thousand one President Bush walked into the Rose Garden and announced we've developed a strategy/.,ontonotes5
uh We're going to work with the United Nations the EU the GB to follow this money/.,ontonotes5
We have a president of the United States/.,ontonotes5
Look at the criticism that the press got after Iraq that we did not do our job on WMD/.,ontonotes5
or would you rather go after The New York Times the Supreme Court on the Guantanamo ruling we'll talk about that later and make hay and say They're tying our hands in the war on terrorism/?,ontonotes5
They're going to love it even more if Congress takes up uh legislation on Guantanamo/.,ontonotes5
Now that struck everybody in Washington as totally foolish Because for the last fifty years every single embassy in this town is bugged/.,ontonotes5
In the United States today we have more than our share of the nattering nabobs of negativism/.,ontonotes5
I didn't write the Des Moines speech uh Pat Buchanan did that Where he really zapped the press/.,ontonotes5
It's about the United States of America and the security of the United States of America/.,ontonotes5
Again the difference is the government of the United States was elected to protect our security/.,ontonotes5
On issue after issue it has become clear that The Times believes the US is not really at war/.,ontonotes5
Let's turn to Guantanamo and the Supreme Court/.,ontonotes5
What is the political fallout John from the Guantanamo decision/?,ontonotes5
It isolates the United States/.,ontonotes5
Politically I think they could come out ahead on this In part because as we just heard Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer say the US uh Congress is going to take up very soon legislation giving the President this authority/.,ontonotes5
Guantanamo/.,ontonotes5
which is the point not just on Guantanamo But all of these programs/.,ontonotes5
And on Guantanamo this has cost us a lot internationally as a defender a primary defender of human rights/.,ontonotes5
Bill Safire should the administration take this as a cue to just shut Guantanamo or accept the John McCain approach now towards/?,ontonotes5
And they'll keep Guantanamo/.,ontonotes5
Because of our involvement in Vietnam and because of what has happened at the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate case a great many of our youth have lost faith in our institutions/.,ontonotes5
"Accordingly, this is the first peasant organization to be legally registered and designated a peasant association since the founding of the PRC.",ontonotes5
"With these questions in mind, this reporter came to Yongji in Shanxi to get the scoop.",ontonotes5
"If you go 13 kilometers west of Yongji in Shanxi, you come to Zhaizi Village.",ontonotes5
The Yongji Peasants Association has its headquarters at the entrance to Zhaizi Village.,ontonotes5

later it was persuaded and prevented by the city of Yongji.,ontonotes5
"That day I went, to the women's association, The women's association gave us that, our Yongji, invited teachers from the Chunlei kindergarten.",ontonotes5
"After a series of women's activities, the spirit of villagers in Zhaizi Village had changed.",ontonotes5
"According to a Yongji official, the reason the Zhaizi Village peasant association has had such a big impact, one major reason is the paralysis of the village committee.",ontonotes5
Zhaizi Village has a total of 263 households.,ontonotes5
"On June 7 of last year, the Yongji Peasants ' Association was formally registered at the Civil Administration Bureau of Yongji City.",ontonotes5
"As we began this year, we put out a report, and, it presented a goal, to become the Number One Village in China within ten years.",ontonotes5
The association is now experimenting in Zhaizi Village.,ontonotes5
"First, we want our villagers ' whole concept of the legal system to be the first in all of China.",ontonotes5
"At 3:42 on July 28, 1976, a strong earthquake hit Tangshan.",ontonotes5
The Tangshan earthquake was a paroxysmal earthquake.,ontonotes5
"In the briefing, the National Seismology Bureau for the first time analyzed the reasons for the failure to report the Tangshan earthquake.",ontonotes5
"Third, it did not understand the seismological and geological signs in the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Bohai, Zhangjiakou area.",ontonotes5
"In that calamity, all of Tangshan was laid waste.",ontonotes5
"And yet in the county seat of Qinglong County in Hebei Province, although it is only 115 km from here, not even one person in the whole county died in the great earthquake.",ontonotes5
"On the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the Great Tangshan Earthquake, that is in April of 1996, Qinglong was chosen by a United Nations agency to become a successful model for the integration of scientific research and administrative management.",ontonotes5
"In fact, on August 20, 1976, the Hebei Science Committee had issued a brief report which for the first time revealed the facts about Qinglong having successfully prepared against the Great Tangshan Earthquake.",ontonotes5
"Right up until 1995, when the United Nations ' Dr. Kohl came to Beijing to participate in the world Conference on Women and learned about Qinglong for the first time.",ontonotes5
"The following year, after receiving permission from the Chinese government, this female UN official headed up a team in person and conducted an on-site investigation in Qinglong.",ontonotes5
"Beginning at that time, the Qinglong phenomenon gradually became known to the outside.",ontonotes5
"Speaking of the Qinglong miracle, there are two people we can not forget; one is Wang Chunqing and the other is Ran Guangqi.",ontonotes5
"At the time Wang Chunqing was in charge of seismic work for the Qinglong County Scientific Committee, and it was he who first brought news of the great earthquake back to Qinglong.",ontonotes5
Why was Qinglong able to do it and Tangshan wasn't?,ontonotes5
Qinglong!,ontonotes5
At the time Ran Guangqi was serving as Qinglong County secretary and county head.,ontonotes5
"From that moment, all of Qinglong County went into pre-earthquake mode.",ontonotes5
"The report said that the Tangshan earthquake had damaged 180,000 homes in Qinglong County, with 7,300 of these collapsing, but only one person had died as a direct result of the earthquake.",ontonotes5
Perhaps there are more lessons to be learned from Kailuan than from Qinglong.,ontonotes5
"When the Great Tangshan earthquake hit, why was it that the Kailuan mine was able to keep the mortality rate at only 0.07%?",ontonotes5
"At the time, about half the Kailuan miners were stuck underground.",ontonotes5
"Um, for example, , the Lu jiatuo mine had a vertical-shaft ladder, and at the time there were more than a thousand people in the mine, male, female, old and young.",ontonotes5
Not one of the Lu jiatuo Mine's underground personnel had been lost; more than a thousand people escaped death deep underground in this dangerous situation.,ontonotes5
I really admire this group of CCP members who were at the Lu jiatuo Mine in 1976.,ontonotes5
The CCP members who were at the Lu jiatuo Mine in 1976 were the last to come up.,ontonotes5
"Qinglong County successfully issued the imminent earthquake warning, and 470,000 people in the entire county got through the disaster unscathed.",ontonotes5
"There simply wouldn't have been such a tragedy. If there had been communication at all levels, and the people of Tangshan had been warned. Uh, even if you don't have a definite date.",ontonotes5
"Even though the Tangshan seismic monitoring network had, so many earthquake warning signs, uh ,",ontonotes5
"every province and city has so many emergency reporting offices, look at Tianjin, Beijing, Hebei, they all have emergency reporting stations.",ontonotes5
"When you did your investigation, and you discovered that at the time China's level was such as to be able to predict this earthquake, what did you think?",ontonotes5
"All I can say is, this is the sadness of 240,000 wronged souls of Tangshan.",ontonotes5
"I respectfully represent the 240,000 Tangshan dead, and to the people of the former Tansghan, earthquake monitoring network, you predicted the Great Tangshan Earthquake, you reported the emergency, you made every effort.",ontonotes5
"Before the Great Tangshan Earthquake, China had medium-long-range forecasts, it had annual forecasts, it had imminent forecasts.",ontonotes5
"Therefore the Tangshan earthquake, I still say, we are not at the levels, , to forecast on time, on July 28, 1976, at approximately 3:42.",ontonotes5
"We're not at the level to report that Tangshan City, the small area of Fengnan in Tangshan, but we can report for the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan and Zhangjiakou area.",ontonotes5
"If you look at the Tangshan disaster records, many people might get the impression that the Great Tangshan earthquake was not just a natural disaster, but that it was made up of many human disasters.",ontonotes5
"What is even more unexpected is that two Chinese seismologists who precisely predicted the Tangshan quake and who have spent a lifetime doing earthquake research coincidentally believe that China has not made progress in earthquake forecasting levels, but has actually gone backwards.",ontonotes5
"If the thing were to, happen in today's China, do you think disaster could be avoided?",ontonotes5
"Now it could not be avoided, now China doesn't have, uh, this capacity.",ontonotes5
"So in terms of China, it doesn't have this capacity.",ontonotes5
"In today's China the level of earthquake forecasting, I believe, compared to before the Tangshan earthquake, has fallen, has slipped by a wide margin.",ontonotes5
"In the, '80s, exactly which year I'm not sure, a conference was held in Quanzhou, we who believe in monitoring and preparedness by the masses call it the three earths, earth electricity, earth stress, and earth magnetism, they denied it all.",ontonotes5
"I say the method of monitoring and preparedness by the masses used before the Tangshan quake, and methods that produced this prediction.",ontonotes5
Standing tall on Taihang Mountain is the Monument to the Hundred Regiments Offensive.,ontonotes5
"This is Zhuanbi Village, Wuxiang County of Shanxi Province, where the Eighth Route Army was headquartered back then.",ontonotes5
This map was the Eighth Route Army's depiction of the Mediterranean Sea situation at that time.,ontonotes5
"In 1940, the German army invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.",ontonotes5
"From one side, it seized an important city in China called Yichang.",ontonotes5
"Um, , uh, through Yichang, it could directly reach Chongqing.",ontonotes5
"Ah, that threatened Chongqing.",ontonotes5
"Then they would, ah, bomb these large rear areas such as Chongqing.",ontonotes5
"So, along with the coordinated, er, economic blockade, military offensives, and strategic bombings, er, a simultaneous attack was launched in Hong Kong to lure the KMT government into surrender.",ontonotes5
"By 1940, China's War of Resistance against Japan had entered a stalemate.",ontonotes5
"The Eighth Route Army guerrillas were extraordinarily active, creating more and more trouble for the Japanese army in North China.",ontonotes5
"Roads and railways were used as links to connect all of North China into a solid, widespread siege, in order to strangle the Eighth Route Army and its base areas in this net.",ontonotes5
"In December 1939, Commander-in-chief Zhu De and Vice Commander Peng Dehuai of the Eighth Route Army received a top-secret telegram from Commander Lu Zhengcao of the Jizhong Military District, among other people.",ontonotes5
"The telegram said that the Japanese troops were building blockade trenches and chessboard-like roads to divide the Jizhong base area into small isolated blocks without the ability to mutually communicate and support each other, causing the Eighth Route Army and the guerrillas to lose maneuverability.",ontonotes5
"Before the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940, an inclination to compromise, ah, surrender, was an extremely serious crisis in the frontline situation in China.",ontonotes5
"Well, on the battlefield behind enemy lines, in order to take over, consolidate the area under its occupation, Japan began a new strategy.",ontonotes5
"On July 22, 1940, a campaign preparation order to attack the Zhengtai Railway, jointly signed by Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Zuo Quan, was sent to Yan'an and all units of the Eighth Route Army.",ontonotes5
"It was to break through the Japanese army's siege policy against base areas behind enemy lines, and to avert the crisis of China's compromise and surrender.",ontonotes5
"Beginning from August 20, from August 20 to September 10, the main purpose of the campaign was to sabotage the Zhengtai Railway.",ontonotes5
"The Zhengtai Railway started from Zhengding, Hebei in the east and ended in Taiyuan in the west, with a total length of 243 kilometers traversing the Taihang Mountain range.",ontonotes5
"During the War of Resistance against Japan, the Zhengtai Railway was a key strategic transportation line for the Japanese army in North China.",ontonotes5
"Along this railway line was the Niangziguan Pass, a natural barrier, and the Jingjing coalmine, a key fuel base in Yangquan for the Japanese military in North China.",ontonotes5
"Outside of Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang, the Japanese military deployed the 4th, 8th, and 93rd mixed brigades and regiments, which were scattered among 50 strongholds along the railway line.",ontonotes5
"On a night in late July 1940, the atmosphere in Zhuanbi Village in Shaanxi was unusual.",ontonotes5
"By the time we got up early the following morning, the sports ground in Zhuanbi Village was packed with soldiers who had stationed there.",ontonotes5
"Upon arriving, he relayed an order, saying the road from Yangquan to Hedi must be cut off tonight, with the electrical wires slashed.",ontonotes5
"He himself would bring, this group of people to blow up that Wudu bridge.",ontonotes5
"Led by Nie Rongzhen, the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military District was ready for an offensive, while at the same time, fifteen regiments laid an ambush in advance along the Zhengtai Railway, launching fierce attacks on Japanese military strongholds along the railway line.",ontonotes5
"On the night of August 20, offensives were launched against most of the Japanese independent 4th mixed brigade and part of the independent 9th mixed brigade along the western section of the Zhengtai Railway.",ontonotes5
"Additionally, two regiments, together with local armed forces in places such as Pingding, Liaoxian, and Yushe, carried out sabotage on the Pingliao and Yuliao roads and pinned down the enemy at various points, ensuring safety of the main forces on the sides and rear.",ontonotes5
"It was still during this night that the 120th Division, directed by Division Commander He Long and Political Commissar Guan Xiangying, with 20 regiments, sabotaged the northern section of the Tongpu Railway and some main roads west of the railway.",ontonotes5
"It also took over strongholds at Yangfangkou, Kangjiahui, and Fengrui Village, cutting off the northern section of the Tongpu railway and the roads from Xinxian to Jingle and Fenyang.",ontonotes5
"In order to coordinate with breakthrough battles at the Zhengtai Railway and the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, the 129th Division and the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military District also ordered their units to deploy more than 50 regiments Yang to Lishi in cooperation with militias, to launch widespread sabotage and raids on the Pinghan, Pingsui, Beining, Baijin, Jinpu, and Deshi railway lines, among others, as well as some main roads and many strongholds occupied by the Japanese army.",ontonotes5
"When asked about the actual combat strength of the Eighth Route Army, the combat operation director reported: There are 30 regiments along the Zhengtai Line, 15 regiments along the Lugou Bridge-Handan section of the Pinghan line, 12 regiments along the Datong-Hongdong section in Tonghu County, and four regiments along the Tianjin-Dezhou section of the Jinpu Line, with a total of 105 regiments entering the campaign.",ontonotes5
The Hundred Regiments Offensive dealt a devastating blow to the enemy at Shi'nao Mountain.,ontonotes5
"This is Shi'nao Mountain, situated in Yangquan, Shanxi, a strategic passage of the Zhengtai Railway back then.",ontonotes5
"On August 21, 1940, in order to pin down Japanese troops stationed in Yangquan and to cover for militiamen sabotaging the western section of the Zhengtai Railway, the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army ordered the main regiment of its 385th Brigade, the 14th Regiment led by Brigade Commander Chen Xilian, to head directly for Shi'nao Mountain to seize the high ground.",ontonotes5
"Frustrated and angry, the Japanese army immediately deployed a large number of troops in an attempt to retake Shi'nao Mountain.",ontonotes5
"To the enemy's complete surprise, desolate Shi'nao Mountain had been turned into a strong combat fortress by our troops in less than a night.",ontonotes5
"Like a lion with its mouth wide open, towering and rugged Shi'nao Mountain was constantly waiting for any invaders who dared come close.",ontonotes5
"Starting from the 23rd, the Japanese army in Yangquan, backed by helicopters, launched nonstop fierce attacks on Shi'nao Mountain using chemical weapons.",ontonotes5
"During the Shi'nao Mountain battle, our soldiers died in large numbers.",ontonotes5
"From the Zhengtai road, from, um, Zhengding to, um, Shijiazhuang, to Taiyuan, more than 400,000 civilians participated in destroying roads.",ontonotes5
Most important at that time along the Zhengtai road was mainly to destroy the Jinxi coal mine.,ontonotes5
"In this way, they fought the battle while at the same time destroying roads, stripping the entire 60-li-long railway from Xingtai to Neiqiu within just a few days.",ontonotes5
"Overseas Japanese in Yangquan City were all mobilized to participate in the battle, including children of 15 to 16 years of age.",ontonotes5
"During the first phase from August 20 to September 10, 1940, a general offensive was launched on major transportation lines such as the Zhengtai, Tongpu, Pinghai, and Jinfu lines with an emphasis on destroying the Zhengtai Railway.",ontonotes5
"The Eighth Route Army smashed successive large-scale sweep operations launched by the Japanese army and puppet army against anti-Japanese bases in Taihang, Taiyue, Pingxi, Beiyue, and northwest areas of Shanxi, among others.",ontonotes5
"At that time, the Hundred Regiments Offensive greatly encouraged the vast numbers of soldiers and civilians, with news of fighting spreading rapidly throughout the Taihang Mountain area.",ontonotes5
"After the Eighth Route Army launched the Hundred Regiments Offensive, newspapers from areas behind enemy lines in North China to the large rear area continuously carried news of victories.",ontonotes5
Telegrams and letters of congratulation arrived in Yan'an from all directions.,ontonotes5
"By pinning down large numbers of Japanese soldiers on battlefields behind enemy lines in North China, the Hundred Regiments Offensive delayed the Japanese army's aggression southward.",ontonotes5
The Hundred Regiments Offensive wrote a glorious page in the history of China's War of Resistance against Japan.,ontonotes5
"On June 30, 1987, the Monument to the Hundred Regiments Offensive was erected on Shi'nao Mountain in Yangquan, Shanxi, where the heroes had fought the battle.",ontonotes5
"In 1993, six villagers in Honghecao Village set up the Hundred Regiments Offensive Museum at the place of Nie Rongzhen's operational command.",ontonotes5
Old Li Jingtang still tells visitors old war stories circulating in the Taihong Mountain area.,ontonotes5
Taihang Mountain will forever remember that great battle during the Chinese people's War of Resistance against Japan.,ontonotes5
The Burma Road was the lifeline artery for China's anti-Japanese battlefields.,ontonotes5
"The Tengchong Battle, an annihilation of the Japanese army, became a typical example for the China war area.",ontonotes5
"We respectfully invite you to watch a bloody battle fought side-by-side by China, the US, and Britain 60 years ago in a joint effort to repel Japanese invaders.",ontonotes5
"On August 17, Taiwan's investigation department and police held a press conference announcing the closing of the March 19 shooting case.",ontonotes5
"Since the suspect identified by Taiwan police mysteriously died after the March 19 shooting incident, the case was not prosecuted.",ontonotes5
"However, people from various circles in Taiwan think there are many suspicious points in this case.",ontonotes5
"On August 17, the Taiwan military held the Lianhsing 94 amphibious landing exercise, testing and enhancing the army's response capabilities and its combat ability in repelling an enemy's amphibious landing.",ontonotes5
Taiwan's investigation department and police announced the closing of the March 19 shooting case.,ontonotes5
"Well, why did Taiwan's investigation department say this was the closing of the case instead of the actual truth about the shooting case?",ontonotes5
"On August 17, Taiwan's investigation department and police solved the case and announced the March 19 shooting case was closed.",ontonotes5
Abramov had a car accident in Moscow last night and was seriously injured.,ontonotes5
"US President Bush and Russian President Putin participating in the 13th Informal APEC Leaders ' Meeting in Pusan, South Korea, met briefly today before the meeting began.",ontonotes5
"However, according to White House officials, Bush and Putin mainly discussed a series of topics such as anti-terrorism, the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, the Iran nuclear issue, and the Russian accession to the WTO.",ontonotes5
"Prior to the APEC meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited Yasukuni Shrine for the fifth time and was strongly condemned by Asian nations such as China and South Korea.",ontonotes5
What kind of situation will Japan find itself in at the APEC summit?,ontonotes5
What heavy prices will Japan pay for Koizumi's paying respect to the ghosts?,ontonotes5
"The APEC meeting is being held these days in Pusan, South Korea.",ontonotes5
"Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi also arrived in Pusan this afternoon, beginning his APEC trip this time.",ontonotes5
"Well, prior to this, many analysts all think that during his trip to the APEC meeting in Pusan, this time, Junichiro Koizumi may likely be isolated by various parties.",ontonotes5
"The reason is that in its persistent alignment with the US, Japan has ignored its relations with other countries, especially its Asian neighboring countries.",ontonotes5
"Well, what kind of situation will Japan find itself in at the APEC summit?",ontonotes5
What kind of impact will Koizumi's lame diplomacy produce on the international image of Japan?,ontonotes5
"We have invited to our studio Professor Liu Jiangyong and Professor Jin Xide, two experts on Japan issues.",ontonotes5
"Well, we all know that Koizumi arrived in Pusan this afternoon.",ontonotes5
"Ah, first of all, I think, ah, , this time, ah, when Koizumi arrived in Pusan, ah, he had this in his mind.",ontonotes5
"That is, through multilateral meetings, he attempted to meet with, ah, leaders of South Korea or other Asian nations, Uh-huh. so as to--Uh-huh. demonstrate that even though he visited Yasukuni Shrine, Uh-huh. his relations with neighboring countries are not affected.",ontonotes5
"Well, during this meeting, er, President Roh Moo-hyun clearly pointed out, ah, what did he point out? That is, er, the visit to Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese leaders, politicians, and statesmen, is a, , provocation, ah, to South Korea.",ontonotes5
"That is, originally this year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan.",ontonotes5
"Er, well, according to the original arrangement, that is, President Roh Moo-hyun should pay a visit to Japan, ah, at the end of this year.",ontonotes5
", that is to say, to Japan, to Prime Minister Koizumi, this is a very difficult diplomatic journey.",ontonotes5
"However, Roh Moo-hyun actually met with him ceremonially as a host because APEC held the meeting in South Korea.",ontonotes5
"Well, actually, regarding, um, Koizumi's attendance at this APEC summit, people are more interested in the relations between Japan and its Asian neighboring countries, including the kind of alliance relationship between the US and Japan, and so on.",ontonotes5
"Well, speaking of the relationship issue, we have noticed that during US President Bush's visit in Japan, Koizumi made some declaration of this position.",ontonotes5
"He said, as long as we get on good terms with the US, then it follows naturally we will have good relations with our Asian neighboring countries.",ontonotes5
"Well, this is because he is still using the pre-Cold-War diplomatic thinking after the Cold War, that is, the United States is the number one superpower in the world.",ontonotes5
Japan is the second largest economy in the world.,ontonotes5
"Well, looking at the situation in Asia, actually, it is exactly the other way round.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, if it does not get on good terms with its Asian neighboring countries, then in reality the US will become even more hard-line in its diplomacy with Japan.",ontonotes5
"As for Japan, to the US, it furthermore has lost some assets, diplomatic assets when making negotiations with the US.",ontonotes5
"Well, just recently, it's needless for us to say, er, that Japan's relations, we can say, with its neighboring countries this year have suffered overall deterioration.",ontonotes5
"These include Japan's relations with South Korea, China, and Russia which are all deteriorating, well, even including its relations with the US.",ontonotes5
"In fact, , even today, we also noticed a piece of news that although at, um, the recent two-plus-two meeting, er, the US and Japan again reached an intermediate report, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, today, actually the head of Japan's Defense Agency again mentioned to the US that it seems to feel regretful ,",ontonotes5
"Because, according to the two-plus-two intermediate report just reached, the US military bases in Japan should undergo adjustment.",ontonotes5
"However, it was met with strong opposition from the general public in Japan.",ontonotes5
"So, now the JDA head came to talk with the US, saying, whether our interests can be taken into consideration again, er, in this intermediate report.",ontonotes5
"That is, between the US and Japan, centering upon this intermediate report, actually the deal is again partially completed.",ontonotes5
"So, such a prime minister like Koizumi, who blindly follows the US as the guideline of his diplomacy, was rarely seen even during the Cold War era.",ontonotes5
We know that in 1957 Japan had three diplomatic principles.,ontonotes5
"Well, some prime ministers before Koizumi at least would still properly deal with and balance the relations with America, with the US and Asia, in particular, with China, ah.",ontonotes5
"Well, when it comes to Koizumi, he only takes good care of the relations with the US.",ontonotes5
"In fact, he will surely fail to take good care of the relations with the US because if you can not win the trust of your Asian neighboring countries, the US will not fully respect such a country.",ontonotes5
"The US also wants to go beyond Japan to keep good relations with China, South Korea, and other Asian countries.",ontonotes5
"Therefore, the more he follows the US, the lower will be his actual status in Asia.",ontonotes5
"Right, his idea was actually criticized and opposed by some politicians even in Japan.",ontonotes5
"Many people also mentioned, by valuing the US alone, you are ignoring Asia.",ontonotes5
"For instance, this time at the APEC meeting in Pusan, when he mentioned, er, Japan's relations with China, he still used this kind of, that is to say, rhetoric, to defend himself.",ontonotes5
"He said, er, , ah, right now, Japan-China relations are not like, er, what the international community is worried about.",ontonotes5
"For instance, from January to August this year, the latest statistics show that Japan's exports to China grew only by 3.2% according to China's statistics.",ontonotes5
It grew only by 5.8% according to Japan's statistics.,ontonotes5
"In other words, Japan's exports to China were declining sharply.",ontonotes5
"Well, at the same time, with respect to Japan's investment in China, during the first half of last year, Japan's investment projects in China decreased by 8.2% while the contractual amount decreased by 0.4%.",ontonotes5
"They both showed that due to the cooling down of the political relationship, well, the economic relations between China and Japan have already been severely affected.",ontonotes5
"Originally, Koizumi's key fallacy for his visits to Yasukuni Shrine was that my visits would not affect in any way our relations with Asia.",ontonotes5
"Well, when Koizumi visits Yasukuni Shrine, he is betting on the national interests of Japan.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, he is selling the international image and national interests of Japan at cheap prices.",ontonotes5
"Many Japanese people also see that this does not conform to Japan's own fundamental interests, ah, as a country with so many international, um, interests.",ontonotes5
"At the same time, it also actually denigrates Japan's image.",ontonotes5
"Ah, people may also frequently ask such a question that since it is the most important thing for a country to keep good relationship with its neighboring countries, why would Japan want to seek far and wide for what lies close at hand?",ontonotes5
"It also reflects that nowadays Japan, in its eagerness to become a political power, well, wants to take advantage of the sentiments of extreme nationalism to move toward and realize this goal.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, if Japan wants to become a powerful country commanding true respect, it must get rid of the name of a defeated country, the name of an aggressor country in World War II.",ontonotes5
"Well, this road he takes will surely isolate Japan from the international community and will definitely not make it a political power in the end.",ontonotes5
"For example, regarding his visits to Yasukuni Shrine, , he says, if I, keep doing it like this, China, South Korea, ah, , that is to say, you will, grow tired of protesting.",ontonotes5
He did not know this issue could bring big trouble to Japan.,ontonotes5
"Well, we can say that an overall review of the current diplomatic status of Japan should show two clear roads.",ontonotes5
"Ha, one is to follow the US blindly, which is one of its very important diplomatic lines.",ontonotes5
"Well, speaking of this, we can also figure out that Koizumi has seriously damaged the feelings of his Asian neighboring countries several times since he took office as Japan's prime minister in 2001.",ontonotes5
"In February 2005, just one day after Chinese people's traditional Spring Festival, the Japanese government claimed the lighthouse set on Diaoyu Island by Japan's extreme rightist group without permission as its national property and put in under the administration of Japan.",ontonotes5
"On March 16, 2005, Japan's Shimane Prefecture assembly voted to pass a measure bill concerning Takeshima Day and officially designated February 22 as Takeshima Day.",ontonotes5
"As a result, this small island just a bit over 90 kilometers from Utsuryo Island, South Korea, again triggered a diplomatic conflict between the two countries.",ontonotes5
South Korea thinks that this island called Dokdo Island has always been a Korean territory.,ontonotes5
Instead the Japanese claims of sovereignty of South Korea's Dokdo Island and China's Diaoyu Island were added.,ontonotes5
"Eh, at that time, he pledged to reform Japan's internal political and economic situations.",ontonotes5
"So, right now, another important question is how exactly people in Japan view Koizumi's diplomatic or internal policies, Professor Jin?",ontonotes5
"Well, we know that the most important pillar in Japan that supports the Japanese society is the Japanese business community.",ontonotes5
"Well, the heads of several groups in the business community, for instance, the Japan Business Federation and the Japan Committee for Economic Development, all had frequent direct meetings with Koizumi, strongly cautioning him not to visit Yasukuni Shrine, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. because our economy will suffer if our Japan can not survive in the international community.",ontonotes5
"Well, we have noticed that in response to such questions, some analysts recently noted that Japan's diplomacy will pay a heavy price for what he has been doing.",ontonotes5
"As a matter of fact, Professor Liu, you also mentioned earlier that Japan's economy, for instance, the Sino-Japanese trade, has already been affected to some extent.",ontonotes5
"Well, I think, actually, as far as Japan itself is concerned, it still made some mistakes by itself.",ontonotes5
"Well, this itself also failed to meet Japan's own demand for economic development and the trend of strengthening economic and trade relations with foreign countries, in particular, the eastern Asian region, well, so as to bring about economic cooperation in this region.",ontonotes5
"Well, looking at Japan's economy, we should say it is currently recovering its growth.",ontonotes5
"Well, externally, it mainly relies on the US and Chinese markets.",ontonotes5
"However, if the Chinese market suffers from economic cool-down as political coldness takes heat off economic development, it should produce a very negative effect on Japan's economy.",ontonotes5
Japan placed its hope of becoming a permanent member of the Security Council this year.,ontonotes5
"Well, among many reasons that blocked Japan from getting accepted this year, the most important one was that its neighboring countries did not cast favorable votes.",ontonotes5
"Therefore, we should say that it is, right, this Prime Minister Koizumi who has single-handedly ruined Japan's dream of becoming a permanent member of the Security Council.",ontonotes5
"Some analysts also mentioned this point, that is to say, right now, Japan's neighboring countries are basically very much disappointed with what Koizumi has been doing.",ontonotes5
"Well, many countries have all abandoned their hopes to further mend their relations with Japan.",ontonotes5
"Well, actually, right now even the European and US media have noted this issue.",ontonotes5
"We, including US President Bush, who came to Pusan following his visit to Japan this time and then will arrive again in China, are, in fact, also very concerned with this future development of Sino-Japanese relations.",ontonotes5
That is because I recently met an American scholar whose first question to me was whether there will be any conflict in the East China Sea region.,ontonotes5
"That is, the US public and scholars have, started to show concerns over the issue of right and wrong in WW II, the moral issue, that is, the US has started to pay attention to this issue.",ontonotes5
The US has kept quiet on the issue of Yasukuni Shrine because it wants to get along with everyone.,ontonotes5
But now the US can no longer sit quietly any more.,ontonotes5
"I think that if things go on like this, the US interests in this region are also going to suffer.",ontonotes5
"This is one of the important indexes that, we should watch for regarding which road exactly Japan will take.",ontonotes5
"That is, in fact, I now feel that he, er, is somewhat adopting a China policy that separates politics from economy.",ontonotes5
"Well, in politics, he will go against you, eh, mainly on the issues of Yasukuni Shrine and textbooks, but in economic and trade affairs, er, he still wants to safeguard Japan's economic rights.",ontonotes5
"He is using some, eh, people who are, for instance, er, relatively moderate and pragmatic toward China.",ontonotes5
", for instance, a politician quite friendly with China, that is, Toshihiro Nikai, um, was appointed as minister of Economy, Trade and Industry.",ontonotes5
"Well, we also see that after Nikai took office, his speech on the Eastern China Sea issue, we should say, is quite appropriate.",ontonotes5
"Ah, in his opinion, he wants to have friendly negotiations, ah, with China if he sees that China, er, has taken any action.",ontonotes5
He does not think Japan's unilateral action in this disputed area is friendly negotiation.,ontonotes5
"We are certainly willing to watch for this, and will continue to monitor Japan.",ontonotes5
"Well, as we mentioned earlier at the beginning, eh, a very important purpose for Koizumi to go to attend the APEC leaders ' summit in Pusan this time is to see if he could try to improve the relations with neighboring countries through talks with President Roh Moo-hyun, as if he were clutching at a life-saving straw.",ontonotes5
"But, could you analyze and predict what kind of achievements he can make during his trip to Pusan?",ontonotes5
"Well, some people say that as China's economy is growing, Japan is getting somewhat jealous.",ontonotes5
"For instance, China's economy is growing, eh, and getting stronger, but we see the relations between China and South Korea are indeed developing rapidly.",ontonotes5
"Well, the current trade between China and South Korea has reached nearly 100 billion US dollars.",ontonotes5
"Er, within another period of time, er, that is, by 2012 when it is, the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South Korea, 200 billion US dollars ' worth of economic trade can be reached.",ontonotes5
"So, this will have surpassed what it is now for Japan and China which still failed to reach 200 billion US dollars at this 33rd anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic relations.",ontonotes5
"We can say, the economic development in South Korea and China, to borrow Roh Moo-hyun's words, is developing rapidly.",ontonotes5
"In addition, we can see that South Korea has been improving its relations with all neighboring countries with the exception of Japan.",ontonotes5
China has also significantly improved its relations with all neighboring countries with the exception of Japan.,ontonotes5
It is the same with Russia.,ontonotes5
"So, just as we mentioned at the start of the program, during his trip to Pusan, Koizumi must feel not only isolated but also surely frustrated.",ontonotes5
"Over the weekend, the weather in the South will change significantly.",ontonotes5
"Although it is still overcast and rainy tomorrow from the eastern part of the southwestern region to this area south of the Yangtze River, it will turn cloudy by the day after tomorrow in the area south of the Yangtze River.",ontonotes5
Let's take a look at North China.,ontonotes5
Tomorrow morning it will be foggy in parts of North China.,ontonotes5
"In addition, there will be snowfall in southern Gansu.",ontonotes5
"Beijing, cloudy, 2 to 8 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Harbin, sunny, 11 degrees below zero to zero degree.",ontonotes5
"Changchun, sunny, 9 degrees below zero to 1 degree.",ontonotes5
"Xi'an, cloudy, 6 to 12 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Shijiazhuang, foggy changing to sunny, 1 to 9 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Shanghai, overcast changing to light rain, 11 to 15 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Nanjing, overcast, 8 to 13 degrees.",ontonotes5

"Paris, sunny, 1 degree below zero to 9 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Vienna, sunny, 3 to 7 degrees.",ontonotes5
"New York, cloudy, 7 to 9 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Seattle, cloudy changing to sunny, 5 to 8 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Washington, sunny changing to cloudy, 4 to 6 degrees.",ontonotes5
"After repeatedly postponing his trip to Japan, Russian President Putin finally arrived at Japan's Haneda Airport on November 20, beginning a three-day visit to Japan.",ontonotes5
It can be said that the four northern islands issue is always an obstacle that Putin can not sidestep while visiting Japan.,ontonotes5
"Heading a Russian business delegation of more than one hundred people this time, Putin wants to improve bilateral relations through promoting economic development.",ontonotes5
And will economic and trade exchange between Russia and Japan be hampered because of this?,ontonotes5
"Well, at the beginning of the program, let's learn about the situation in Japan.",ontonotes5
"Let's now connect via telephone with Mr. Wang Xinsheng, an expert on Japanese issues from Beijing University who is currently visiting Japan.",ontonotes5
"However, the general reaction from scholars, media, or ordinary people here, er, is rather low key, because, er, there has been no progress on the two issues that Japan is relatively concerned with, the Northern Territories issue, er, and the oil pipeline route issue.",ontonotes5
"Regarding the Northern Territories issue, , er, President Putin purposely avoided this issue, that is, he did not really want to talk about it.",ontonotes5
"Well, on the oil pipeline route issue, though the Russian side promised to connect it with Japan, there was no talk about prioritizing a connection with Japan.",ontonotes5
"The media here is concerned because Russia already promised to prioritize connecting it with China, er, , so the media here is concerned that it is an empty promise.",ontonotes5
"In this way, Japan may not get, er, any material benefit, while the Russian side will have gained Japan's support for its WTO accession.",ontonotes5
"Er, in addition, at the Business Federation meeting, Russian President Putin urged the Japanese business community to invest in Russia.",ontonotes5
"However, due to the territorial issues, or little progress on the territorial issues, along with the business community's concerns with the investment environment in Russia, well, it remains a big question how far economic cooperation can go.",ontonotes5
"Well, what kind of response did people in Japan have to, well, some of the achievements this trip to Japan has made?",ontonotes5
", that is to say, ah, er, we also saw, er, in Tokyo, some right-wing groups held demonstrations, demanding that Russia, return the four northern islands.",ontonotes5
"Okay, thank you very much, Professor Wang, for briefing us on the relevant information in Japan.",ontonotes5
"Just now, this Professor Wang talked about Putin's visit to Japan this time.",ontonotes5
"Although the two sides signed 12 agreements, it seems that Japan is not very satisfied with the content of the agreements, ah, in terms of the content, because it seems that neither of the two issues that Japan wanted greatly to talk about, the four northern islands issue and the oil pipeline issue, made the achievements they had anticipated.",ontonotes5
"As we know, Putin has kept putting off this visit to Japan since last year, like back then when Yeltsin repeatedly postponed his trip to Japan.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, Japan asked for too high a price.",ontonotes5
"That is, it asked the Russian president to come to Japan to make concessions on territorial issues.",ontonotes5
"Well, Russia's attitude was that it would not talk about territorial issues if it went.",ontonotes5
"Well, , from the perspective of Japan, without discussion of territorial issues, the talks were viewed as making no progress.",ontonotes5
"Well, what Russia actually wants is economic cooperation with Japan ,",ontonotes5
"including the development of oil resources in eastern Siberia, and, um, some other investment and trade.",ontonotes5
"Well, Japan is still like this, saying first return the territories, then we can talk about economics.",ontonotes5
"Er, Director Xing, it can be said that this time one of the very important purposes of President Putin's visit to Japan is to facilitate the progress of bilateral relations through economic development.",ontonotes5
The visit to Japan was in itself one of Putin's important aims.,ontonotes5
"So, well, , how did he come to Japan?",ontonotes5
"As mentioned earlier, ah, it had been postponed again and again, but by way of this kind of opportunity, well, Putin's visit to Japan was smoothly accomplished.",ontonotes5
"It was that Russia sent a very important message, that is, Russia is willing to develop relations with Japan.",ontonotes5
"Well, in fact the theory of joint development was originally proposed by Russia.",ontonotes5
"It had been raised prior to that too, but Japan did not accept it at that time.",ontonotes5
Japan's recent reaction is not Japan's mainstream domestic opinion.,ontonotes5
"Well, domestic political circles in Japan all opposed this suggestion by Taro Aso.",ontonotes5
"They said that with joint development, Russia would advocate adopting the current Russian controlled situation, the current situation, and applying Russian law.",ontonotes5
"Well, by making investments there, in fact, well, it would be equivalent to permanent recognition that the four islands are Russia's.",ontonotes5
"Regarding the joint development he talked about, Russia is also very interesting.",ontonotes5
", the Japanese proposed it, now Russia instead rejected it.",ontonotes5
"Well, this also has a lot to do with Russia's strategy of building a powerful nation.",ontonotes5
"Russia now, it has independently formulated a strategic vision of developing the Far East and Siberian regions.",ontonotes5
"Well, before this, we have one more question, that is, er, regarding the issue of this Russian President Putin's repeated postponement of his visit to Japan ,",ontonotes5
"Why did Russian President Putin visit Japan again after, an interval of five years, after quite a few twists and turns?",ontonotes5
It can be said that Putin's visit to Japan after an interval of five years was realized following quite a few twists and turns.,ontonotes5
"The Japanese side hoped that after winning the presidential election in March of that year, Putin could personally intervene in the territorial issues existing between Japan and Russia for a long time.",ontonotes5
"However, by May, the Russian side said it could not provide measures for resolving the territorial issues, and Putin's visit to Japan was pushed to the spring of 2005.",ontonotes5
"While Japan expressed helplessness to this, it hoped Putin could visit in February as it was the 150th anniversary of the signing of a trade and border treaty between Japan and Russia.",ontonotes5
"However, Putin responded only with a congratulatory telegram, with no mention of his visit to Japan.",ontonotes5
This move at once infuriated Russia.,ontonotes5
"Accordingly, the date of Putin's visit to Japan turned into a variable which nobody could explain.",ontonotes5
"In various versions, some said Putin would visit Japan in April 2005, some said May, while others said June.",ontonotes5
"In Russia's diplomatic circles, there were even widespread rumors, including that Putin would not visit Japan within the year and that Russia's ambassador to Japan would soon be removed.",ontonotes5
"Furthermore, precisely because of this, Putin's visit to Japan was basically confirmed.",ontonotes5
"This time, on this visit, er, between Russia and Japan, ah, er, as far as Japan was concerned, it really hoped that Russian President Putin would talk about the four northern islands issue during his visit.",ontonotes5
"However, Russia's thinking was, er, we want to develop the economy first.",ontonotes5
"Well, was this also the reason that caused Russian President Putin, in spite of""the two being close neighbors""these five years, to visit Japan again only after, an interval of five years?",ontonotes5
"That is, Gorbachev recognized the four islands issue between Japan and Russia.",ontonotes5
"Well, there was once an opportunity for this, but Japan again did not seize it.",ontonotes5
Russia has changed a lot as well.,ontonotes5
"However, when it came to the critical moment, that is, on the territorial issues, perhaps due to Japan's domestic nationalist sentiments and the sensitivity of the territorial issues, it was impossible for any prime minister to claim for two islands only.",ontonotes5
"That is, it was impossible to give the territories to Japan.",ontonotes5
"Eh, we all know Japan is the second largest economy in the world.",ontonotes5
"Furthermore, Japan is also a very important investor overseas.",ontonotes5
"However, a set of data shows that Japanese investment in Russia accounts for only 1% of its investments overseas, that is, just over 700 million US dollars.",ontonotes5
"Well, as Russia should be said to badly need Japanese funds, as well as badly needing Japanese economic cooperation, well, how urgent do you think Russia's need is?",ontonotes5
I think the time of Russia's most urgent need is already over.,ontonotes5
"At that time, Russia was indeed pressing for Japanese investment.",ontonotes5
Because Russia was in a deep degree of overall crisis.,ontonotes5
"Well, now, the economic crisis in Russia is essentially over.",ontonotes5
"Well, under such circumstances, Russia, er, it can make diplomatic arrangements calmly.",ontonotes5
"Therefore, I think Japan, that is, again lost the best opportunity to enter the Russian market.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, at that time if Japan had made a very good investment in Russia, well, Japan, in terms of Russia's economy, it could have helped Russia's economic recovery.",ontonotes5
"Well, currently Japan is very important to Russia again.",ontonotes5
"Well, as a neighboring nation, especially as Japan is a world economic power, Russia really needs Japanese investment, now not Japanese aid, but its investment.",ontonotes5
"He used an expression, saying that Russia's diplomacy is economic diplomacy.",ontonotes5
"All, diplomatic activities must promote Russia's prosperity, eh, development, and wealth and power.",ontonotes5
"Well, seen from this perspective, well, Japan is very important to Russia.",ontonotes5
"Therefore, just now you mentioned some figures regarding Russian-Japanese relations, that is, economic and trade relations, for such a large, such a powerful economy as Japan, well, it invested only 700-plus million in Russia.",ontonotes5
It has nearly reached 200 billion between China and Japan.,ontonotes5
"er, between Russia and Japan, the trade volume only equals, of Sino-Japanese trade volume, one twenty-second.",ontonotes5
"I will explain two issues--one, it may show that the economic environment in Russia is indeed not very good.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, it is not that Japan does not need the Russian market.",ontonotes5
"Putin came this time bringing more than 100 people, such a large delegation, to Japan.",ontonotes5
"I think that with regard to Japan's relations with Russia, it has been like this since the 1970s.",ontonotes5
"I will invest, I will give you aid to develop eastern Siberia.",ontonotes5
That's because Russia has a vast area of land.,ontonotes5
"So, that is, Japan used economics for political purposes.",ontonotes5
"In fact, regarding Putin's visit to Japan this time, the media earlier predicted, among other things, that when the time came, there would be more than 60 groups totaling more than 700 people, along with, hey, more than 200 propaganda trucks on the streets of downtown Tokyo, to protest against Putin's visit to Japan.",ontonotes5
And what impact will it have on Putin's visit to Japan?,ontonotes5
"But, with regard to this Russian issue, ah, this can not be simply regarded as a handful of people making trouble, because there are widespread historical grievances among ordinary people in Japan against Russia.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, this involves the origin of the Northern Territories issue.",ontonotes5
"In fact, ownership of the Northern Territories has changed several times, and there has been no single law.",ontonotes5
"Now Russia says this was the result of WWII international laws and treaties, with the US also recognizing it at that time.",ontonotes5
The entire international community recognizes that the four islands should belong to Russia.,ontonotes5
Both the Yalta Agreement and Article 2 of the San Francisco Treaty recognize Japan's relinquishment of the Kuril Islands.,ontonotes5
"However, then there is a lot of nationalist sentiment, that is, Japan believes that the Soviet Union unilaterally broke the Pact of Neutrality, sending troops into Northeast China and defeating the Kwantung Army.",ontonotes5
"For things like this, as Japan looks at this piece of history--also, Japanese captives were dragged to Siberia to labor camps--I heard there were 100,000, 200,000.",ontonotes5
"Therefore, unraveling this historical feud, the Northern Territories issue, is not so clear-cut, since history, society, and law, as well as nationalist sentiments are all entangled together.",ontonotes5
"The four islands, Iturup, Shikotan, the Khabomai Rocks, and Kunashir, are located in the northern part of the western Pacific Ocean, with a total area of about 5,000 square kilometers, which Japan calls the four northern islands, and Russia calls Southern Chishima.",ontonotes5
"In August 1945, the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in succession.",ontonotes5
"To ask the Soviet Union to declare war against Japan, the US and Britain gave Russia the Chishima Islands and the southern part of Sakhalin Island, which Japan occupied at the time.",ontonotes5
In 1955 the Soviet Union and Japan began negotiations regarding the normalization of relations.,ontonotes5
The then Soviet Union indicated willingness to return the Khabomai Rocks and Shikotan.,ontonotes5
Yet Japan requested that the Soviet Union return Iturup and Kunashiri as well.,ontonotes5
It also requested that the Soviet Union promise to attend the international peace conference to determine the ownership of Sakhalin and the entire Chishima Islands.,ontonotes5
"In 1956, the then Soviet Union restated its willingness to return the Khabomai Rocks and Shikotan.",ontonotes5
"Japan again said that unless the four islands were returned together, the Soviet proposal could definitely not be accepted.",ontonotes5
"Well, we noticed, er, just now this short clip also talked about it, at that time the Soviet Union agreed to return two islands first, , but, eh, Japan never agreed.",ontonotes5
"But now, we also notice that, Taro Aso proposed a new idea, the joint development that the Soviet Union had previously talked about.",ontonotes5
"Oh, as I just mentioned, it was against a large background that Russia first proposed it.",ontonotes5
"With, quite a troubled economy, Russia needed Japanese investment, needed Japan to get involved through this channel.",ontonotes5
"Well, now that its economy has greatly improved, Russia does not need to take this diplomatic risk.",ontonotes5
"Second, Russia should be seen as a rather strong nation.",ontonotes5
"So, well, Putin's visit to Japan this time, or during his visit to Japan, or prior to this, there were rallies in the Far East region, including the Sakhalin area, meant to give many warnings to Putin.",ontonotes5
"Well, one Russian politician stated very clearly that while Russia's territory is vast, Russia does not have territories to spare.",ontonotes5
"That is, doesn't Russia advocate a double-headed eagle policy?",ontonotes5
"Well, if he wants development in Asia, won't he close the door if he loses hold of the four northern islands now?",ontonotes5
"The four northern islands not only have mineral deposits, oil, and fisheries, but also for military strategy, they are key positions in the Pacific Ocean.",ontonotes5
"In the Pacific Ocean, right.",ontonotes5
"Currently Russia seems to be in a period of low tide, but it won't stay this way forever.",ontonotes5
It would benefit Japan.,ontonotes5
Russia has foreseen the consequences.,ontonotes5
That's why Russia now rejects it.,ontonotes5
"It was originally proposed by Russia, but rejected by Japan.",ontonotes5
"That is, Russian-Japanese relations, from the perspective of Russia, I don't see many changes in the large framework of Russian-Japanese relations.",ontonotes5
"However, current signs show that Russia and Japan are moving forward on economic issues, on economic cooperation.",ontonotes5
One example is that this year Toyota Motor has invested in St. Petersburg.,ontonotes5
"That is to say,--Japan has now invested in Russia.",ontonotes5
"Second, what Japan hopes to get is, hey, Russia's oil.",ontonotes5
"Though Russia did not make a final commitment, there is already a general framework.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, eventually Russia's oil pipeline will be connected to a Pacific Ocean port, which will benefit Japan.",ontonotes5
"Okay, well, today we will end our discussion here on the topic of Putin's visit to Japan.",ontonotes5
A British newspaper revealed that the US had planned to bomb the al-Jazeera TV station in Qatar.,ontonotes5
Was this a joke told by US President Bush or was it a long-meditated threat?,ontonotes5
Why can a TV station in a small Arab country have US President Bush on pins and needles?,ontonotes5
"On November 22, the British newspaper Daily Mirror revealed that US President Bush once planned to bomb the al-Jazeera TV station headquarters, setting off a mighty uproar.",ontonotes5
"According to a report by the British newspaper the Guardian, al-Jazeera TV station is now considering suing US President Bush for this matter.",ontonotes5
Mr. Ruan Zongze has done extensive researches on British and US issues.,ontonotes5
"The other is Mr. Wu Huixuan, former CIR chief correspondent based in Qatar.",ontonotes5
What we are seeing now on screen is a very popular newspaper in Britain called the Daily Mirror.,ontonotes5
"The article writes that the minutes of a meeting between British Prime Minister Blair, who was visiting the US on April 16, 2004, and US President Bush at the White House showed that Bush had intended to take military actions against al-Jazeera TV station headquartered in the Qatari capital of Doha.",ontonotes5
"Well, it happened, er, that our correspondent did an interview at the al-Jazeera's Beijing office today and happened to videotape the image we are watching now, which was broadcast live by al-Jazeera TV station.",ontonotes5
"Well, Director Yuan, I know that you also once worked in Britain.",ontonotes5
What al-Jazeera TV station is now asking Britain to do is to either confirm the news as true or to deny it.,ontonotes5
"However, right now, Britain has neither said it is true nor said it is not.",ontonotes5
"On April 16 of last year when Blair was visiting the US, they had some exchange between them.",ontonotes5
"Well, but the very authenticity of the incident, I think, still needs to be determined by the British government or US government.",ontonotes5
"Well, Mr. Wu, we know, ah, you worked as a reporter in Qatar and were very familiar with al-Jazeera TV station.",ontonotes5
I think it is possible that the US wanted to bomb al-Jazeera TV station.,ontonotes5
"That's because all the things reported by al-Jazeera TV station since its establishment in 1996 were those the US did not want viewers in the world to look at, especially with respect to the Afghan war and Iraq war.",ontonotes5
What they reported was entirely incompatible with the so-called freedom of the press advocated by the US.,ontonotes5
"For instance, the US attacked al-Jazeera TV station several times.",ontonotes5
"It happened once that when Bush, er, together with that Defense Secretary Rumsfeld visited Qatar, they, put pressure on the Qatari government, saying you should not broadcast these news items that were harmful to the US.",ontonotes5
"But, the leader of al-Jazeera TV station, Jazeera, ah, Qatar replied that we advocate the same freedom of the press as the freedom of the press in your country and that our government has no right to interfere with what is being reported by a private TV station.",ontonotes5
"That is to say, eh, according to your judgment, this incident was possible because the US has long considered it a thorn in its flesh.",ontonotes5
"So, to say that the US government or the US president had such an idea, you think many people may easily believe it.",ontonotes5
"As a matter of fact, when we watch TV, we can see many news services, ah, including the US CNN and the British BBC, often replaying footage by al-Jazeera TV station.",ontonotes5
"Al-Jazeera TV station, established in November 1996 in Qatar, is an Arabic-language news TV station broadcasting global news and reports nonstop around the clock.",ontonotes5
"In September 2001, the 9/ 11 attacks broke out in the US.",ontonotes5
"On October 7, the US and Britain launched military strikes on the Taliban in Afghanistan.",ontonotes5
"When people all over the world expected to watch the live broadcast of the war by the US CNN, they could only see a few blurry images on TV.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, however, the little known al-Jazeera TV station based in the small Gulf country of Qatar suddenly emerged to broadcast the progress of the Afghan war in Arabic language and mobilized its 27 reporting stations all over the world to conduct an around-the-clock follow up coverage.",ontonotes5
"When the Taliban regime announced that reporters from all countries were banned from entering the territory of Afghanistan, al-Jazeera TV station was the only one that could enter the Taliban-controlled area.",ontonotes5
"Taking such an advantage, al-Jazeera TV station started to establish its unique leading position in covering the Afghan war with its frequent live broadcast of missile attacks on the Afghan capital of Kabul.",ontonotes5
"While the US military searched everywhere for information on bin Laden in vain, al-Jazeera TV station frequently aired the footage of bin Laden making a speech.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Wu, we know that you happened to be in Qatar when al-Jazeera TV station was just established in 1996.",ontonotes5
We reporters in Qatar were also invited to attend this inaugural broadcast ceremony.,ontonotes5
"In this respect, that is, let me add one point, that is, this al-Jazeera TV station, ah, its style is very much characterized by direct borrowing from the West, for instance, the two mainstream media outlets.",ontonotes5
"Just now, that is to say, many of its reporters directly came from the Middle East channel at that time.",ontonotes5
That was jointly run by BBC and Saudi Arabia.,ontonotes5
He studied in Britain and therefore had quite a good knowledge of Britain's BBC TV station.,ontonotes5
"For instance, Britain's BBC is a very old TV group established in 1927.",ontonotes5
"Well, speaking of its influence, we have also noticed that er, during the Afghan war, er, because it has the exclusive interview right to enter Afghanistan to conduct independent and exclusive interviews, we could say this is one of its advantages.",ontonotes5
"Besides, it has a lot of resources, including its exclusive coverage right in Afghanistan as you mentioned just now.",ontonotes5
"For instance, a very tough conflict in this region is the conflict between Palestine and Israel.",ontonotes5
"In particular, it was the same with the, Iraq war, which took place in Iraq.",ontonotes5
"In the, Iraq war, as far as I know, among foreign media teams dispatched to Iraq for coverage, I should say, the one from Qatar's al-Jazeera TV station was the most powerful.",ontonotes5
"It had three reporting stations at that time, one group in the south in Basra, well, one group in Baghdad, and still another group in the north in Mosul.",ontonotes5
"So it was basically covering the, um, Iraq war from all perspectives.",ontonotes5
"However, as it is becoming more and more influential and competitive, it has also become a thorn in the US side.",ontonotes5
What conflicts are there between al-Jazeera TV station and the US?,ontonotes5
Why has it become a thorn in the US side?,ontonotes5
"However, at the same time, the conflict between al-Jazeera TV station and the US has been increasing.",ontonotes5
"The US government thinks that radicals, anti-American and religious commentators have become frequent guests at al-Jazeera TV station.",ontonotes5
All these made the US hate and fear al-Jazeera TV station at the same time.,ontonotes5
"During the Iraq war, al-Jazeera TV station not only broadcast Bush's and Blair's impassioned pre-war speeches and the image of coalition troops marching toward Iraq, but also broadcast the bloody bodies of civilians next to bombed cars.",ontonotes5
"If you see the war on the US TV as an electronic game and grand display of smoke and fire, then from the footage by al-Jazeera TV station, you see the war only as hell.",ontonotes5
"Well, it is exactly because of this, even if al-Jazeera TV station may not be necessarily linked with any other organizations, simply because it reports the war using a different voice, it has become the target of attacks by the US or the West.",ontonotes5
"But when our correspondents went to have an interview at the al-Jazeera TV station's Beijing office today, they asked their office administrator named Ezzat, ah, the question why the US threatened to bomb al-Jazeera TV station?",ontonotes5
He is also a China expert and speaks excellent Chinese.,ontonotes5
"-- In the Middle East region, in particular, currently, , some US officials, for instance, many Democrat officials, they admitted that the US policies on Iraq and the Middle East, eh, region have many mistakes.",ontonotes5
"In addition, the US government is carrying out some measures and work against these people in the Middle East region and against the world peace.",ontonotes5
"As you know, we were, eh, reporting the war in Fallujah.",ontonotes5
We simply showed people the footage about Fallujah.,ontonotes5
"Well, in fact, the US has long been suppressing al-Jazeera TV station.",ontonotes5
"For instance, the al Jazeera TV station's office in Afghanistan was bombed in 2001.",ontonotes5
"Well, in 2003, the al-Jazeera TV station's office in Baghdad was also bombed.",ontonotes5
"On April 8, its reporting station in Baghdad was bombed, and one reporter was killed.",ontonotes5
"In addition, currently one of its reporters is still detained by the US at the Guantanamo military base.",ontonotes5
"Eh, it was said that a Sudanese correspondent from al-Jazeera TV station, er, was arrested in Afghanistan and has been detained ever since at this, er, US military base at Guantanamo.",ontonotes5
We could say that the US has been suppressing al-Jazeera TV station for quite a long time.,ontonotes5
He basically also blamed it on the US.,ontonotes5
"Well, will al-Jazeera TV station really sue US President Bush?",ontonotes5
Will US President Bush have any occasion or opportunity to have this matter clarified?,ontonotes5
"Well, now we have seen that the director of al-Jazeera TV station has also flown to London to demand an explanation from Blair.",ontonotes5
"It will stay as a topic of public commentaries, because if the US indeed had such a plan, then, the freedom of speech it advocates will be again greatly discounted.",ontonotes5
"We know that the US, like the West, they made a lot of efforts in controlling the right of speech in the international mainstream media.",ontonotes5
"During the Kosovo war, the US blew up the radio station of, the former Yugoslavia.",ontonotes5
It indeed blew up this radio station of Yugoslavia.,ontonotes5
"Then, later, the Westerners themselves, including the US, admitted that the reason why it won the Kosovo war was to a large extent that they won the other party in public opinion.",ontonotes5
"For that purpose, it is now seriously investigating the news about the US plan to bomb the al-Jazeera headquarters in reported by, ah, the British newspaper, and it hopes that the British government can explain this.",ontonotes5
Tomorrow there will be two significant weather changes in China.,ontonotes5
The scope of precipitation in the South will significantly increase.,ontonotes5
So it will further spread to Hubei and Hunan.,ontonotes5
"In spite of being overcast and frigid, rainfall will also bring cleaner air to the area south of the Yangtze River plagued with smog.",ontonotes5
"In the meantime, another significant change will occur in the most part of Eastern China.",ontonotes5
"From tonight through tomorrow, temperatures will significantly drop 4 to 8 degrees in places from northeast China, North China to the Huang-Huai and the Jiang-Huai regions.",ontonotes5
"However, the day after tomorrow, that is, this Friday, a stronger cold current will enter Xinjiang in our country.",ontonotes5
"Beijing, cloudy changing to sunny, to 6 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Harbin, sunny, 14 degrees below zero to 6 degrees below zero.",ontonotes5
"Changchun, light snow changing to cloudy, 11 degrees below zero to 5 degrees below zero.",ontonotes5

"New York, cloudy, 5 to 13 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Seattle, sleet changing to medium snow, to 3 degrees.",ontonotes5
"Washington, overcast, 8 to",ontonotes5
Maybe make Japan the last place.,ontonotes5
and she said when she talked to him that he indicated there were not many%um interested in studying in the U S because they were a not very motivated group.,ontonotes5
"and then everybody went up to North Park and changed clothes ,",ontonotes5

We got this book from my mom about the Carribean.,ontonotes5
"And,%um. I 'd always wanted to go to the Carribean.",ontonotes5
%um but although they're trying to solicit more throughout the globe instead of just Japan,ontonotes5
although they've had most interest in Japan.,ontonotes5
Was it difficult going back to the U S?,ontonotes5

Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said that the redistricting of the congressional districts one of which is in Georgia violated the Constitution because it was based primarily on race.,ontonotes5
"and we talked about like political correctness and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment, feminism and just like different topics that they might encounter in America where the people have different attitudes than here in Russia.",ontonotes5
But I'm not really up on what the attitude is in America because I haven't been there in so long.,ontonotes5

Gao Xingjian's avant-garde plays made him persona non-grata in his native China and he fled the country in 1988.,ontonotes5
He settled in France becoming a French citizen two years ago.,ontonotes5
Gregory Lee is a professor of Chinese and Chinese literature at the University of Lyons in France.,ontonotes5
"Tell us a little bit about him, Who is he and why did he flee China.",ontonotes5
Gao Xingjian is quite an interesting writer because in some senses he differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that are well known in the West today.,ontonotes5
"Well, this is very interesting because Mr. Gao left China before Tianenmen.",ontonotes5
"So, we can see immediately that the resonances with the play of Beckett, but Gao Xingjian really before 1989 felt, that he was unable to write and to have his plays produced, as he would wish, and so left China couple of years before the incident at Tiananmen in 1989.",ontonotes5

There are sharp increases here just as Zimbabwe has slumped into its worst economic crisis since becoming independent in 1980.,ontonotes5
"In three days of unrest Army helicopters have dropped teargas in poor suburbs of the capital Harare, but many of those protesting say they won't stop until Mugabe, the man they blame for the country's economic problems, surrenders the presidency.",ontonotes5

Zimbabwe now has Africa's fastest shrinking economy.,ontonotes5
Many of us like to characterize Zimbabwe's crisis as an economic crisis but it is wider and deeper than economy.,ontonotes5
"You can see the price of bread go up, you can see your bus fares go up, you can see companies closing down or working short weeks and that sort of thing, but you can also read Zimbabwe's crisis in the number of destitute people on the streets, in the number of crimes being committed.",ontonotes5

"Journalist Carlos Depalazai was in Rome, Italy and Carlo how does this fellow plan to profit from the sheep of the Abruzzo?",ontonotes5
"He is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having in the Italy at the moment, one is internet, the other one is the awareness on food.",ontonotes5

Five years ago they were negotiating with Milosevic at Dayton to stop the war in Bosnia.,ontonotes5
Two years ago they were still shuttling back and forth to Belgrade in an effort to solve the Kosovo crisis.,ontonotes5
"When Milosevic was indited on war crimes charges soon after, US and other Western officials began calling for his arrest and transfer to The Hague, but now that a delicate transition is underway in Serbia, those calls have grown quieter, according to Gary Bass, the author of the new book about war crimes trials, ` Stay, the Hand of Vengeance '.",ontonotes5
Bass says US diplomats don't want to risk destabilizing Serbia's fragile political situation by pushing too hard for war crimes trials.,ontonotes5
"In Germany after World War I and in the Ottoman Empire also after World War I, the British and the French pushed really hard for war crimes trials, and the result in both countries was a kind of a nationalist backlash.",ontonotes5
"A nationalist backlash in Serbia right now could play into Milosevic's hands, especially with parliamentary elections scheduled for next month.",ontonotes5
"That's one reason Western governments are not demanding his immediate arrest, but critics of this approach say letting Milosevic stay in Belgrade could be equally destabilizing.",ontonotes5
"It means that the government of Yugoslavia has to become very serious about dealing with the indited war criminals, beginning with Slobodan Milosevic himself.",ontonotes5
But even officials at The Hague say they are willing to be patient with the new Yugoslav President.,ontonotes5
"They have already indicated that they are willing to allow the reopening of the prosecutor's liaison office in Belgrade, and that's certainly a welcome first step.",ontonotes5

Greece's second bout of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5.,ontonotes5
For those hoping to see a modicum of political normalcy restored--in view of Greece's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government--there is but one bright sign: The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass.,ontonotes5
"On the other, the so-called Coalition of the Left and Progress--a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro-Communist cousin, the Hellenic Left.",ontonotes5
"With regard to Greece's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal, Mr. Papandreou's principal accuser remains George Koskotas, former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler, now residing in a jail cell in Salem, Mass., from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that would return him to Greece.",ontonotes5

"In the midst of his 1988 re-election campaign, Sen. Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, returned$ 76,000 in contributions after a Detroit newspaper said that Mr. Keating had gathered the money for him about two weeks before the meeting with regulators.",ontonotes5
"In addition, Sen. McCain last week disclosed that he belatedly had paid$ 13,433 to American Continental as reimbursement for trips he and his family took aboard the corporate jet to Mr. Keating's vacation home at Cat Cay, the Bahamas, from 1984 through 1986.",ontonotes5
"In July, California newspapers disclosed that Mr. Keating gave$ 850,000 in corporate funds to three tax-exempt voter registration organizations in 1987 and 1988 at the behest of Sen. Cranston, who conceded that soliciting the money was ``a pretty stupid thing to do politically.''",ontonotes5
"In addition, Sen. Cranston received$ 47,000 in campaign donations through Mr. Keating, and the California Democratic party received$ 85,000 in corporate donations for a 1986 get-out-the-vote drive that benefited the senator's re-election campaign that year.",ontonotes5

"But in the wake of the shootings in Beijing on June 4, the Hong Kong toy industry is worrying about its strong dependence on China.",ontonotes5
"Although the manufacturers stress that production hasn't been affected by China's political turmoil, they are looking for additional sites.",ontonotes5
"The toy makers, and their foreign buyers, cite uncertainty about China's economic and political policies.",ontonotes5
"Indeed, Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, long before the massacre.",ontonotes5
Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China.,ontonotes5
"By diversifying supply sources, the toy makers don't intend to withdraw from China, manufacturers and foreign buyers say.",ontonotes5
It wouldn't be easy to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade.,ontonotes5
"A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong's port, airport, banks and support industries, such as printing companies, have made China's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site.",ontonotes5
"``South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world ,'' says Henry Hu, executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd.",ontonotes5
Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border.,ontonotes5

"Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China, where an estimated 120,000 people are employed by the toy industry.",ontonotes5
"``For the next few years, like it or not, China is going to be the main supplier ,'' says Edmund Young, vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd., one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border.",ontonotes5
"In the meantime, as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites, they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia.",ontonotes5
"Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand, including Matchbox, Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co., the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. Ting.",ontonotes5
"Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied.",ontonotes5
"With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992, several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain, Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites.",ontonotes5
"Worries about China came just as Hong Kong's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies, Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc.",ontonotes5
"Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry, causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management.",ontonotes5
"Still, they long for a ``mega-hit'' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S., Hong Kong's biggest market for toys and games.",ontonotes5
The closest thing the colony's companies have to a U.S. mega-hit this year is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of action figures manufactured by Playmates Holdings Ltd.,ontonotes5
"Paul Kwan, managing director of Playmates, says 10 million Ninja Turtles have been sold, placing the reptilian warriors among the 10 biggest-selling toys in the U.S..",ontonotes5
"Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season, which accounts for about 60% of U.S. retail toy sales, Mr. Kwan said the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates.",ontonotes5
Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988.,ontonotes5
"Besides the lack of a fast-selling product, they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System, an expensive video game made by Nintendo Co. of Japan.",ontonotes5
Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing's austerity programs launched late last year.,ontonotes5
"Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided only three days a week in recent months, down from five days a week, as the province's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity.",ontonotes5
Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4.,ontonotes5
"Also, concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong, which has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms.",ontonotes5
"But, toy manufacturers and other industrialists say Beijing will be restrained from tightening controls on export-oriented southern China.",ontonotes5
They say China's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong.,ontonotes5
The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion.,ontonotes5
The administration urged the justices to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William Rehnquist last July when the high court upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions.,ontonotes5

Ruan stated that Beijing's basic position on Taiwan has not changed at all since the days of Deng Xiaoping.,ontonotes5
"The only thing the Chinese Communists are saying, says Ruan, is that they will attack""if Taiwan makes any sort of formal move toward independence,""and Taiwan has no need to formalize anything because changing the country's name would be meaningless.",ontonotes5
""" No matter what you call yourself, people are still going to call you Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"It's just like in England-the official name is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but nobody calls it that.",ontonotes5
""" Taiwan needs to be more pragmatic,""says Ruan,""just like the mainland. """,ontonotes5
"Similarly, when Chen Shui-bian negotiates with Beijing, no one will worry about him selling Taiwan down the river.",ontonotes5
"The noted political commentator Chin Heng-wei, chief editor of Taiwan's Contemporary Monthly, agreed strongly with Ruan's comments, and added,""In this election the people of Taiwan were even more concerned about domestic issues than they were about cross-strait relations. """,ontonotes5
"Virtually everyone at the seminar was in agreement that it is neither advisable nor necessary to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue, and that Taiwan need only avoid stirring up Chinese nationalism.",ontonotes5
Wei Chengsi -LRB- news director at ATV news in Hong Kong and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in Shanghai -RRB- emphasized the fluid nature of Beijing's policy on Taiwan.,ontonotes5

"You must not think that ' the communists won't attack because the US won't let them, ' and then go out of your way to provoke them to where they no longer have an out.",ontonotes5

"Second, the People's Liberation Army hopes to parlay the Taiwan issue into increased influence in domestic politics.",ontonotes5

"Says Tseng,""Reunification depends entirely on whether China can democratize. """,ontonotes5
"He stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between Beijing, Washington, and Taipei.",ontonotes5
The seminar attendants also examined Taiwan's domestic situation.,ontonotes5
"This group feels a loss of status, for during the many decades of KMT rule they have always thought of themselves as a privileged""majority""in Taiwan even though in fact they are a minority.",ontonotes5
"They do not identify with Taiwan as their home, and they have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis-a-vis the local majority.",ontonotes5
This development should help to bring about long-lasting ethnic harmony in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
Reform of the KMT and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in Taiwan.,ontonotes5

"In the case of the Dominican Republic, for example, supporters of President Mejia announced to the media on the eve of President Chen's arrival that mainland China was planning to build a large thermal power plant in their country.",ontonotes5
"In addition, the Dominican Republic is seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2002, and will certainly be lobbying for Beijing's support.",ontonotes5
This situation could affect relations with Taiwan.,ontonotes5

"The ROC team took one gold, two silvers, and four bronzes, marking the first time any Taiwan athlete has returned from an Olympic games with a gold.",ontonotes5
"Also, as part of the events, Taiwan's Crescent Moon Dance Troupe, made up of handicapped persons, was the only foreign troupe invited by the Australian government to participate in the Paralympic Arts Festival.",ontonotes5
"The host government even set up a huge TV screen in Darwin, which is the port of entry for the most visitors to Australia, to broadcast the games live.",ontonotes5
"On October 14, Taiwan's Crescent Moon Dance Company created a sensation with their performance""Standing on the Highest Peak,""performed in traditional vests and short skirts as worn by indigenous people in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
The troupe also delighted Sydney citizens with a performance at the Sydney City Hall on October 19.,ontonotes5
"In the competition, host country Australia took the most medals, including 64 golds",ontonotes5
"Among the ROC's medals, the gold-the first ever for Taiwan-was won by Chiang Chih-chung.",ontonotes5
"Chiang, a member of the Bunun indigenous people, received a traditional hero's welcome home from the Bunun of Sanmin Rural Township in Kaohsiung County.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals, but fell just short of the gold each time.",ontonotes5
"Among Asian countries, South Korea turned in the best performance, taking five gold medals.",ontonotes5
This was due in part to the fact that the ROK government has provided special coaching in wheelchair table tennis to soldiers injured in service.,ontonotes5
"Indeed, many handicapped competitors from other nations besides the ROK were retired veterans.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan team members, on the other hand, come from a variety of backgrounds, and train out of personal interest.",ontonotes5
"Pali: Storied Past, Uncertain Future",ontonotes5
I wonder if Pali is jealous of Tanshui.,ontonotes5
"I ask because fate has treated these two towns, separated only by the mouth of the Tanshui River, very differently.",ontonotes5
"Tanshui is celebrated in poems, songs, paintings, and lovers ' memories of its scenic views.",ontonotes5
"Pali has donuts, mussels, a garbage landfill, and troubles which have yet to be revealed to the outside world.",ontonotes5
"Liao Tianding, Taiwan's Robin Hood, fleeing from imperial soldiers, took refuge in Pali, where he fell in love with a local woman, and, later, at age 27, was murdered in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in Pali Rural Township -RRB- by one of his best friends.",ontonotes5
"Countless legends grew up around Liao after his death, and the people of Pali began to worship his spirit.",ontonotes5
"They also recall that the Pali of those days was a place in which most people lived by fishing, farming, or petty trading.",ontonotes5
"Yet, he may not know about Pali's real heyday, long in the past.",ontonotes5
"Pali was originally called Palifen, a transliteration of the place name used by the Ketagalan indigenous people.",ontonotes5
"Located on the northwest corner of Taiwan, Pali faces the Taiwan Strait to the northwest, rests against Mt. Kuanyin to the southeast, and looks across the river toward Tanshui to the northeast.",ontonotes5
"Though it doesn't have much of a hinterland, its geographic location has proved historically important, as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed at the Ta-pen-keng and Shih-san-hang archeological sites.",ontonotes5
"Later, when Han Chinese began trickling across to Taiwan, they mainly settled along rivers.",ontonotes5
"Because Pali is relatively close to the mainland and sits at the mouth of a river, despite the fact that it does not have a natural harbor, in 1757 the Qing court designated it to be one of Taiwan's small number of official ports for maritime transport with the mainland.",ontonotes5
Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in and out of Pali.,ontonotes5
"However, as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that struck in 1796, Pali began to give way in importance to Tanshui, located just across the river.",ontonotes5
"Once mainly dependent on fishing, Pali increasingly came to rely on farming.",ontonotes5
"While the hardy people of Pali barely kept their stomachs filled, their children and grandchildren left in search of a better life.",ontonotes5
"But in the 1970s, urban planning came to Pali.",ontonotes5
Changing the rhythm of Pali life,ontonotes5
"During the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in Taipei, builders put up self-described""villas""and""mansions""-LRB- apartment blocks, in fact -RRB- one after another in Pali.",ontonotes5
"Also, to try to reduce the outflow of population from Pali and to get the stagnant local economy moving, the government decided to link this formerly isolated village to the outside world.",ontonotes5
"What had been Chungshan Road was turned into Provincial Highway #15, and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked Pali directly to the busy Taipei districts of Shilin and Peitou.",ontonotes5
"Gifted with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea, Pali began to dream of a tourism boom.",ontonotes5
"In order to pave the way for the construction of a water treatment facility on the northeast edge of Pali, the plan to develop tourism in Pali was scrapped overnight.",ontonotes5
"Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western Taiwan for construction purposes, and a harbor was built on the Pali coast for the convenience of gravel transporters.",ontonotes5
"In accordance with the urban plan, new streets were cut this way and that through Pali's land, and high-rise buildings sprang up along the sides of these roadways.",ontonotes5
"In 1997, the Hsiachuotzu garbage landfill formally opened, and it became common to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of Pali.",ontonotes5
"This rural township, which was made responsible for storing the garbage from several communities in Taipei County, seemed resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered by many outlying areas -RRB- of having to choke on the garbage spit up by others.",ontonotes5
"It is only recently that the residents of Hsiachuotsu, unable to stand the smell, have begun to protest.",ontonotes5
"Lin Yi-hung, born and raised in Pali, stands on the roof of his house and looks across to the beach where he used to run and play as a child.",ontonotes5
"He can not help but sigh, as he looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that have come to this area:""These construction projects have destroyed the relationship we people of Pali used to have with the sea. """,ontonotes5
"Can the people of Pali really survive change of this magnitude? """,ontonotes5
"One after another, government development plans have raised the expectations of Pali residents.",ontonotes5
"But so far the only things Pali folk have been able to enjoy have been flying dust from construction sites, roads filled with giant trucks, and new neighbors of an""otherworldly""kind.",ontonotes5
The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious to escape from Taipei City and return to nature.,ontonotes5
"But at the same time, verdant Mt. Kuanyin-named for its uncanny resemblance to the deity Kuanyin-is covered with columbariums and cemeteries.",ontonotes5
"Chen Chien-kuo, a secretary in the Pali Rural Township government, says facetiously:""What can we do? We have the mountains behind us and the sea in front.",ontonotes5
"He adds, in a far less amused tone, that the government has been talking about making Mt. Kuanyin a national park for a long time, and has banned construction or use of the mountain.",ontonotes5
""" Nobody seems to care about our Pali, and we are very remote, so people just dump what they don't want out here.",ontonotes5
"Li Li-chuan, who works at Happy Mountain, was born and raised right here in Pali.",ontonotes5
"Located on the margins of the island of Taiwan, the people of Pali take it in stride that they must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast off by society-waste water, trash, the deceased, and victims of diseases that society would prefer not to see at all.",ontonotes5
And there is no sign this situation will end: Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved to Linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked along Provincial Highway #15-right through the heart of Pali.,ontonotes5
Serving Greater Taipei,ontonotes5
""" I believe,""says Lin Yi-hung,""that the people of Pali understand that this is just the way society works -",ontonotes5
"Thus, in urban plans Pali is always assigned the role of serving Taipei.",ontonotes5
"There are a lot of great-sounding plans, but what do the people of Pali get out of them?",ontonotes5
"Chang Tsu-chou, now in his 70s, has been a secretary in the rural township government for more than 30 years, and loves Pali more than words can say.",ontonotes5
"When I came here, they were only selling about 30 newspapers in all of Pali.",ontonotes5
"He has great confidence in Pali's future, and believes the new harbor will bring prosperity.",ontonotes5
"At that time, Pali should really be hopping! """,ontonotes5
"Pali, known as""the home of green bamboo shoots""for its famous local vegetable, is-like many remote areas all over Taiwan-accepting the pain and enjoying the pleasures of life in the space between hopeful expectations and disappointing letdowns.",ontonotes5
"Uncertain whether to makes fists or open their arms, the people of Pali watch, perplexed, as the great wheel of our times leaves its tracks through their rural township.",ontonotes5
Pali Facts and Figures,ontonotes5
"Pali Rural Township -LRB- also spelled Bali -RRB- is located at the northwestern edge of the Taipei Basin, on the western bank of the mouth of the Tanshui River.",ontonotes5
It is one of the 29 townships under the jurisdiction of Taipei County.,ontonotes5
"Pali produces wax apples, green bamboo shoots, and wendan pomelo which are famous far and wide for their delicate texture and sweetness.",ontonotes5
"The main attractions include the so-called""eight views of Pali,""the ferry boat scenic tour, hiking on Mt. Kuanyin, Formosa Wonderworld theme park, and the Liao Tianding Temple.",ontonotes5
"Pali is served by inter-city and local buses, or you can take a shuttle bus from the Kuantu Station of the Taipei rapid transit system.",ontonotes5
"The red Kuantu Bridge connects Pali, a town which nestles at the foot of Mt. Kuanyin, with the outside world, and also adds a splash of color to the lovely river landscape.",ontonotes5
"On the ferry from Tanshui to Pali, decades pass in the blink of an eye.",ontonotes5
"The Shih-san-hang archeological site, located in Tingchuo Village in Pali Rural Township, revealed the secrets of how the plains aborigines of Taiwan lived 2000 years ago.",ontonotes5
"Are the souls of these first residents still looking after""Palifen ""?",ontonotes5
Giant high-rises look on as fishing boats bob in the sea off of the Pali shore.,ontonotes5
What does this tell us about the transformation of Taiwan's townships?,ontonotes5
"Then came the news that Chang Kwang-chih, the respected archeologist and former vice-president of the Academia Sinica, had died of illness in the United States.",ontonotes5
"Each of these men was at the forefront of his field in Taiwan, and their deaths represent the end of an era.",ontonotes5
"Born in Homei, Changhua in 1928, Hsu studied the violin in Japan as a youth.",ontonotes5
"Later, he studied in France for five years, where he became well versed in the various schools of modern Western music.",ontonotes5
"Unfortunately, schools of modern classical music struggled to hold their audiences even in the West, and audiences found it harder and harder to connect with the Taiwanese modern music of which Hsu was the leading figure.",ontonotes5
"In the past decade, with the rise of the""Taiwan first""movement in politics, Hsu's folk music collections have garnered more and more attention, and CDs of them have been released one after another.",ontonotes5
"Just as Hsu's work spanned from the classical to the contemporary, from the West to his native soil, the archaeologist Chang Kwang-chih's broad vision allowed him to build the foundations for the field of archeology both for Taiwan and China as a whole.",ontonotes5
"In his autobiography, Chang describes himself as a""Yam Man,""which is an allusion to Taiwan being shaped like a yam.",ontonotes5
"Chang explains that he was actually born in Beijing, though his father's family was indeed from Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"After Taiwan was returned to Chinese rule, Chang returned to the land of his roots.",ontonotes5
"After earning his doctorate at Harvard, he took an academic post in America but always maintained his focus on Chinese archeology.",ontonotes5
His research showed that the rise of Chinese civilization did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley.,ontonotes5
"In the 1960s, he returned to Taiwan and embarked on research at the Fengpitou site in Kaohsiung, completing the most extensive archeological study made in Taiwan in over a century.",ontonotes5
Then he went on to perform research in an area that spanned the Choshui and Tatu river valleys.,ontonotes5
Many of the leading lights among the younger generation of Taiwan anthropologists cut their research teeth on this project.,ontonotes5
Chang deeply regretted that he was unable to examine the Shangqiu site in eastern Henan.,ontonotes5
"Though sick, Chang returned home at the end of his life to serve as vice president of the Academia Sinica, where he worked hard to establish Taiwan as the preeminent world center for sinology.",ontonotes5
"Born in 1931 in Taoyuan, Tai was educated under Japanese colonial rule, and he earned a doctorate in agriculture at Tokyo.",ontonotes5
"Back in the 1960s, when Taiwanese history was still a taboo subject in Taiwan, Tai organized a research society in Japan devoted to the study of Taiwanese history and other related Asian topics.",ontonotes5
"For this work, he was blacklisted in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"But when he did, his different perspective about Taiwan history brought Tai Kuo-hui farther and farther from the mainstream of the ruling party.",ontonotes5
"Tai, who described himself as an""independent-minded Chinese born in Taiwan,""never lost his affection for China proper, and these sentiments set him apart from most historians of Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan is a part of China, he stated, just as testicles are a part of a man's body.",ontonotes5
His theory was a far cry from Lee Teng-hui's belief that Taiwan should establish clear boundaries between itself and the mainland.,ontonotes5
The former shows that intellectuals in Taiwan need no longer fear torture and imprisonment for their beliefs.,ontonotes5
Hsu Tsang-houei introduced modern Western classical music to Taiwan before making pioneering collections of traditional Taiwanese music.,ontonotes5
Chang Kwang-chih taught for decades at Harvard and Yale but never forgot his homeland Taiwan.,ontonotes5
He made a major contribution toward developing the field of archeology in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
Taiwan's False Cypresses,ontonotes5
"Applying these words to Taiwan, they most aptly describe the Taiwan red cypress, whose tiny seeds are the origin of Taiwan's greatest trees.",ontonotes5
"The Taiwan red cypress witnessed Taiwan's birth, squeezed up by the collision of two tectonic plates, and its progress from a fragile mass of broken rock to a more stable geology.",ontonotes5
It has also witnessed the rise and fall of Taiwan's forestry industry.,ontonotes5
"Hsiuluan Village, an Atayal community in eastern Hsinchu County, was one of the last places in Taiwan to be reached by modern civilization, and was once famous as the""village without lights. """,ontonotes5
"In the mountain forest above Hsiuluan's outlying hamlet of Chenhsipao, bushes and creepers form a dense undergrowth, and a blanket of damp fallen leaves makes the going slippery underfoot.",ontonotes5
"Every ten to 20 meters, a magnificent Taiwan red cypress, thousands of years old and with a trunk three to four meters thick, towers 40 meters into the sky.",ontonotes5
This remnant of virgin cypress forest runs northward to Taoyuan County's Mt. Lala and to Chilan in Ilan County.,ontonotes5
"This great wall of trees acts as a vital""safety valve,""regulating the flow of water into the Shihmen Reservoir, the Tanshui River and the Lanyang River, on which millions of people in northern Taiwan depend for the water they drink.",ontonotes5
"The coat of green which clothes the mountains intimately affects water quality and soil stability in Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli and Ilan Counties.",ontonotes5
"Taiwan's""false cypresses ""-trees of the genus Chamaecyparis, a subdivision of the cypress family, Cupressaceae-are relics of the ice ages which brought them to our geologically young island.",ontonotes5
"But after the ice ages, the high mountains of Taiwan, which were squeezed up from the edges of two tectonic plates a million years ago, became their refuge.",ontonotes5
"Today, only six false cypress species remain anywhere in the world, scattered far apart in North America, Japan and Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"Two of them are native to Taiwan: the Taiwan red cypress -LRB- Chamaecyparis formosensis, a.k.a. the Formosan cypress -RRB- and the Taiwan yellow cypress -LRB- Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana, a variety of hinoki cypress -RRB-.",ontonotes5
"The home of Taiwan's false cypresses is at medium elevations from 1,300 to 2,600 meters, which is Taiwan's area of greatest precipitation and a major source of water for over 100 rivers.",ontonotes5
"In this environment of constant humidity, the Taiwan red cypress grew into East Asia's biggest conifer, with average heights from 30 to 40 meters.",ontonotes5
The cypress forests also mark the transition between Taiwan's broadleaved and coniferous forests.,ontonotes5
Taiwan's Earth God,ontonotes5
"The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999 left Taiwan's landscape covered in scars, but researchers discovered that the places least damaged by the quake were areas of natural forest.",ontonotes5
"Professor Chen Yu-feng of Providence University, who has been studying Taiwan's flora for many years, explains that false cypress forests often grew where river erosion created large areas of debris from rockslides.",ontonotes5
"As tectonic forces pushed Taiwan continuously upwards and the rivers carved their way downward, such areas of collapse occurred in many places.",ontonotes5
In the 19th century human beings swarmed into Taiwan's dark mountains like busy worker ants.,ontonotes5
"After Taiwan was ceded to Japan following the Sino-Japanese war of 1894, while the Japanese were still quelling resistance to their rule they also went into the island's mountains to collect botanical specimens.",ontonotes5
"In 1896, a Japanese biologist collected the first specimen of Taiwan red cypress on Yushan, and before long the Taiwan yellow cypress was found there too.",ontonotes5
"In 1899, the great cypress forests of Mt. Ali were discovered, and in 1912, the Japanese colonial government began large-scale logging there.",ontonotes5
Everywhere the Alishan Mountain Railway passes at higher elevations was once cypress forest.,ontonotes5
Soon afterwards the forests of Mt. Taiping in modern Ilan County and Mt. Pahsien in Nantou were also opened up for logging.,ontonotes5
"Endless streams of cypress logs flowed out of the mountains, and were carried across the sea to Japan to become pillars for Shinto shrines.",ontonotes5
"Quite apart from the incomparable quality of their timber, in terms of numbers alone the Taiwan red and yellow cypress took second and third place among Taiwan's trees, so they became long-term cash cows for the island's forestry industry.",ontonotes5
"After Taiwan's return to Chinese rule, from the 1950s to the 1980s the ROC used forestry income to support its industrial development.",ontonotes5
"The logging grounds advanced deep into Taiwan's heart, consuming even greater areas than under the Japanese.",ontonotes5
All of Taiwan's forest recreation areas today are to be found in the former cypress logging grounds.,ontonotes5
"The Alishan Mountain Railway, and the long forestry roads which wind through Taiwan's four major mountain ranges, were all built for the sole purpose of shifting the huge cypress logs down the slopes.",ontonotes5
""" You could say that everything connected with Taiwan's forestry industry developed around the false cypresses,""says forest ecologist Yang Kuo-chen, an associate professor at Providence University.",ontonotes5
"The history of forestry in Taiwan is a history of false cypress felling, says Yang.",ontonotes5
"If you speak of""hinoki,""the Japanese name of the Taiwan yellow cypress, older Taiwanese will lift their noses as if catching a whiff of its unmistakable fragrance-it has a firm place in their memories as the best of timbers.",ontonotes5
The Taiwan yellow and red cypress each have their own different qualities.,ontonotes5
"The Taiwan yellow cypress grows pencil-straight towards the heavens, and has a higher content of oil, from which a fragrant essence can be refined.",ontonotes5
"In 1971, after the Shinto gate at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo was struck by lightning, the Japanese authorities especially came to Taiwan to buy 11 huge, straight Taiwan yellow cypress logs 16 to 24 meters long, cut from trees over 1,500 years old, to create the world's biggest Shinto gate.",ontonotes5
As for the Taiwan red cypress-merihi in Japanese-it is even more magnificent in appearance than the Taiwan yellow cypress.,ontonotes5
"But the Taiwan red cypress's trunk is often divided, and because it mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone to be eaten away by bacteria, producing strangely tangled hollow trees.",ontonotes5
"This is why the gigantic ancient trees that have escaped the loggers ' chainsaws, such as those at Mt. Ali and Mt. Lala, are all Taiwan red cypress.",ontonotes5
"As the forestry industry gradually declined, the forestry huts built in the Central Range in the Japanese period fell into disrepair, but their cypress-wood washbasins are still as good as new.",ontonotes5
"In the early days, the sleepers used for the Alishan Mountain Railway were cut from broadleaved trees such as beech and Michelia compressa.",ontonotes5
"In short, of all Taiwan's commercial timbers, there's not another to match it.",ontonotes5
"Surveys made before logging began at Mt. Ali, Taiwan's earliest cypress logging area, showed that there were more than 300,000 false cypresses over 1,000 years old, but today all that remains of them is a few lonely-looking old trees scattered among introduced Japanese red cedar -LRB- Cryptomeria japonica -RRB- and flowering cherries.",ontonotes5
"Despite its great fame, deprived of the company of its own species the most celebrated of the giant Taiwan red cypresses of Mt. Ali finally succumbed to lightning and fire.",ontonotes5
"But an even greater cause for regret is that""50 years of intensive false cypress logging tore the heart out of Taiwan's life-support system.",ontonotes5
"With forestry earning no profits, and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups, the Executive Yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests, at last giving a respite to the giant trees which protect Taiwan's land.",ontonotes5
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached.,ontonotes5
"Apart from some scattered local stands, the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt. Hsiukulan in central Taiwan, and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt. Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan, are the island's only remaining forests of giant trees.",ontonotes5
"Amazingly, the ban on logging natural forests has not protected Chilan, the only single-species forest of hinoki cypress surviving in the world today.",ontonotes5
"Before the ban, the Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen -LRB- VACRS -RRB-, which manages Chilan, had already cut down almost 6,000 hectares.",ontonotes5
"In response to this situation a popular movement sprang up to push for the establishment of a""cypress forest national park,""in the hope that with national park status, the last remaining virgin Taiwan yellow cypress forest could be saved.",ontonotes5
"To assure the livelihood of the local Atayal aborigines of Chilan, when the cypress national park is set up consideration will have to be given to how to balance the need to protect the forests with the demand for sustainable tourism.",ontonotes5
How can Taiwan's false cypresses become more than just a tool of human economic activity?,ontonotes5
Can the sad history of cypress logging teach the people of Taiwan a lesson in how to truly care for their land?,ontonotes5
"At the Atayal village of Chenhsipao in Hsinchu County, by three in the afternoon the clouds rolling in from afar have quietly slipped over the ridges and covered the whole mountainside where the cypress trees grow.",ontonotes5
"Here, in Taiwan's remote but vitally important heartland, gigantic trees which have survived the long river of time and escaped the ravages of logging stand undaunted, like guardian spirits quietly protecting the Atayal people and Taiwan's land.",ontonotes5
"Only if we can allow the cypress trees a future, will the people of Taiwan also have a lasting future.",ontonotes5
The virgin Taiwan yellow cypress forest of Chilan dwarfs human visitors.,ontonotes5
"On the pretext of clearing dead wood, many live Taiwan yellow cypresses have been felled in the forest of Chilan.",ontonotes5
The seeds hidden in the tiny conelets of the Taiwan red cypress seem blessed with a mysterious power.,ontonotes5
This Taiwan red cypress planted by the Japanese at Mt. Ali in 1915 has now reached a girth of 70 centimeters.,ontonotes5
But the smallest commercial size of Taiwan red cypress is 150 centimeters.,ontonotes5
Educating Taiwanese Kids in the PRC,ontonotes5
"For Taiwanese expatriates in mainland China, incompatibility between the Taiwanese and mainland education systems is the main reason why most of them do not move their families across with them.",ontonotes5
"In the city of Dongguan, located just over 40 kilometers east of Guangzhou, the ground has already been broken on a project to build the first school for Taiwanese children in mainland China.",ontonotes5
"There is an especially large Taiwanese expatriate community in the Dongguan area, and there are high hopes that the new school, scheduled to begin officially enrolling students in September, will go a long way toward solving the nettlesome problem of education.",ontonotes5
"Says Ye with a worried frown,""Recently my wife has been calling me a lot from Canada to talk about her problems trying to maintain discipline with our kids.",ontonotes5
"Ye has worked hard for many years for the Taiwanese community in Dongguan, a subject he cares deeply about.",ontonotes5
"Of the more than 3,000 Taiwanese business people in Dongguan, less than 5% have been joined by their families.",ontonotes5
"With the extended absence of these people from Taiwan, undisciplined children and lonely spouses""cause a lot of problems for families and society as a whole,""says Ye.",ontonotes5
"some spouses have jobs in Taiwan, crime is a concern on the mainland, and the quality of medical care is not so good there.",ontonotes5
"Grumbles one businessman,""My kids have come home singing the national anthem of the PRC, and calling Chiang Kai-shek a thug and Lee Teng-hui a public enemy.",ontonotes5
"In the opinion of Norman Hsu, vice president of a foods company whose family of four had spent a few years in New Zealand before moving to Dongguan,""The first thing to do is ask the children their reason for saying such things.",ontonotes5
"Taiwanese people in the mainland invariably wish to maintain their ties with Taiwan, and are particularly anxious to ensure that their children can integrate quickly into the school system back home once they return.",ontonotes5
"With the number of Taiwanese in Dongguan increasing in recent years, it was just a matter of time before a Taiwanese school was established.",ontonotes5
"With Taiwanese and mainland authorities at political loggerheads, the school's promoters had to jump through hoops every step of the way in seeking to hire teachers from Taiwan, use Taiwanese teaching materials, and appoint a Taiwanese person to the post of principal.",ontonotes5
They also had to obtain the cooperation of the authorities in Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"Since the people in Dongguan were paying taxes in Taiwan and planning to run the school according to the Taiwanese system, they asked whether the Ministry of Education might not treat the school the same as any private school in Taiwan, and subsidize it accordingly.",ontonotes5
"Teacher seniority was also a major issue in the effort to get the school established; if teachers from public schools were to teach in Dongguan, would they retain the seniority that they had built up in Taiwan?",ontonotes5
"Ye continually stressed to authorities in both Taiwan and the mainland,""Politics is for the politicians.",ontonotes5
"The Dongguan city government has leased an 86,000-square-meter site to the association at an extremely low price, and the school's cornerstone was laid last year in a ceremony held on 3 November.",ontonotes5
H. D. Ye notes that there are now about 400 children of Taiwanese expatriates in Dongguan who attend school in the mainland.,ontonotes5
"Greater than half attend mainland China's regular elementary and secondary schools, while the more affluent Taiwanese send their children to private schools for expatriate children.",ontonotes5
After her elder son and daughter finished elementary school in Taiwan she sent them to a boarding school in Britain.,ontonotes5
"Her ten-year-old child is too young for that though, so she sends him to a school in Shenzhen for the children of Hong Kong expats.",ontonotes5
"The child only comes home once a week, and sending him to the school in Shenzhen costs several hundred thousand NT dollars per year.",ontonotes5
"The Hong Kong elementary school and the international school are both an hour or two away from Dongguan, and many of the Taiwanese in Dongguan want to be able to see their children every day.",ontonotes5
"Some of Little Oxford's 200 students -LRB- such as Norman Hsu's child -RRB- used to go to school in Shenzhen, while others have transferred in from the mainland Chinese public school system.",ontonotes5
"Most of its teaching materials are very similar to those used in Taiwan's elementary schools, and of the 15 or so teachers there, three are from Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"According to Huang Su, executive director of Little Oxford,""A lot of parents keep after me to make sure that the children's education is exactly like the regular system in Taiwan, but I have to remind them that once you've left in Taiwan, you're not regular any longer. """,ontonotes5
"According to Huang, making the school a mirror image of those in Taiwan does not necessarily mean that you are running a good school.",ontonotes5
"Huang Su, who hails from Beijing, majored in English at university and is keenly interested in education.",ontonotes5
"She came to Dongguan after marrying a Taiwanese expat there, and it was the Taiwanese business community that asked her to run a school.",ontonotes5
"In fact, some Taiwanese send their children to Little Oxford from as far away as Zhuhai -LRB- just opposite Macau on the other side of the Pearl River estuary -RRB-.",ontonotes5
Huang has been deeply impressed by the deep concern that Taiwanese parents show for their children's education in the face of difficulties posed by living away from their native Taiwan.,ontonotes5
"Many of them have transferred in and out of lots of different schools in the United States, Taiwan, and the mainland.",ontonotes5
"One bespectacled child laments,""School is better in Canada because they don't have to do so much homework.",ontonotes5
There's too much homework in Taiwan and the mainland.,ontonotes5
Another problem for the school is the lack of interesting things to do in Dongguan.,ontonotes5
""" It's all the more difficult,""notes Huang frankly,""to hold on to teachers from Taiwan, who can't help but compare their situation here with what they are accustomed to in Taiwan. """,ontonotes5
"Dongguan, cradle of scholars",ontonotes5
"Sylvia Yang points out that Little Oxford is a private school with limited space and teaching staff, and even without the boarding expenses charged in Shenzhen, the tuition at Little Oxford still costs RMB 38,000 -LRB- NT$ 160,000 -RRB- per semester, more than many Taiwanese parents can pay.",ontonotes5
"Says H. D. Ye,""We would like to get funding from both the Taiwan and mainland authorities to hold tuition down. """,ontonotes5
"Ye often speaks in Taiwan on the topic of investing in the mainland, something which he knows a lot about.",ontonotes5
It is a large site in the township of Zhongtang.,ontonotes5
"The locals must have taken this message to heart over the years, because it is said that hometown scholars from Zhongtang often took the top spot in the imperial examinations of centuries past.",ontonotes5
"It is very gratifying that a place like Dongguan, with its abundant business opportunities, should also have a scenic spot so rich in scholarly tradition.",ontonotes5
H. D. Ye is a key player in Dongguan's Taiwanese expatriate community.,ontonotes5
He has played the lead role in establishing a Taiwanese school in Dongguan.,ontonotes5
"In the summer of 2005, a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major Hong Kong media.",ontonotes5
"With their unique charm, these well-known cartoon images once again caused Hong Kong to be a focus of worldwide attention.",ontonotes5
"Well, for several years, although it was still under construction and, er, not yet open, it can be said that many people have viewed Hong Kong with new respect.",ontonotes5
Then welcome to the official writing ceremony of Hong Kong Disneyland.,ontonotes5
"The construction of Hong Kong Disneyland began two years ago, in 2003.",ontonotes5
"In January of that year, the Hong Kong government turned over to Disney Corporation 200 hectares of land at the foot of Lantau Island that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years.",ontonotes5
"Since then, this area has become a prohibited zone in Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
"As its neighbor on Lantau Island, Hong Kong International Airport had to change its flight routes to make this area a no-fly zone.",ontonotes5
There's only one month left before the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland on September 12.,ontonotes5
The subway to Disney has already been constructed.,ontonotes5
"At subway stations, passengers will frequently press the station for Disney on ticket machines, trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it first opens.",ontonotes5
"Meanwhile, the Disney subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park.",ontonotes5
"We took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward Disney, trying to experience this mysterious park from close by.",ontonotes5
"Although Disney Corporation chose Hong Kong as the venue for the Chinese Disney park, what they are actually most excited about is the mainland China tourist market.",ontonotes5
"Since the implementation of the Individual Visit Scheme between Hong Kong and the mainland, more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
"From the beginning up till now, more than seven million individual tourists, have come to Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
Hong Kong was developed from a fishing harbor one hundred years ago to become today's international metropolis.,ontonotes5
"When in Hong Kong, you can wander among skyscrapers, heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well-known stores and malls for goods from various countries, and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in Mong Kok.",ontonotes5
"You can go to burn incense and make a vow at the Repulse Bay, where all deities gather.",ontonotes5

"Meanwhile, as various new items are constantly being added, what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the Hong Kong tourism industry bring us?",ontonotes5
"Over the past 28 years, the Ocean Park has basically been a must-see destination for tourists coming to Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
"Watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the Ocean Theater, and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart-beat adventures on amusement rides.",ontonotes5
Or ride the giant Ferris wheel to get a bird's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of Hong Kong Island and the South China Sea.,ontonotes5
"These items, which were the pride of the Ocean Park, have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong for some time.",ontonotes5
"However, since Disney entered Hong Kong, the Ocean Park, sharing the same city as Disney, has felt the pressure of competition.",ontonotes5
It seems that those attractions like the North Pole and the Marine Life Center will also be renovated after several years.,ontonotes5
The area of Hong Kong is only one thousand-plus square kilometers.,ontonotes5
"However, the clever Hong Kong people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the Hong Kong tourism industry.",ontonotes5
Among these is the Avenue of Stars.,ontonotes5
"Entering Hollywood of the East ,",ontonotes5
Hong Kong has always worn the crown of Hollywood of the East.,ontonotes5
"Over the past 100 years of film history, Hong Kong cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors, actors, and screenwriters.",ontonotes5
They have shortened the distance between Hong Kong and the world.,ontonotes5
"Hong Kong movies have even become a window for the world to see Hong Kong, which have made the image of metropolitan Hong Kong more prominent internationally.",ontonotes5
"For this reason, in 2004, on the Waterfront Promenade originally constructed for viewing only the scenery of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor, the Hong Kong Tourism Board also constructed the Avenue of Stars, memorializing Hong Kong's 100-year film history.",ontonotes5
"Here, tourists can learn about Hong Kong's film history, and can come up close with the stars in their mind.",ontonotes5
Hong Kong is a busy metropolis.,ontonotes5
"Across from the Avenue of Stars, a special performance is staged every weekend.",ontonotes5
"%pw As our Victoria Harbor is%pw very famous, and, er, our nightscape is already very beautiful, by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape?",ontonotes5
"So, one idea was to transform Victoria Harbor into a performance stage.",ontonotes5
"The PLA Hong Kong Garrison Plaza, Bank of China Tower, at 8:00 every Saturday night, HSBC Main Building.",ontonotes5
Center of the East Central.,ontonotes5
"Ten landmark buildings located on Hong Kong Island reveal themselves one by one, participating in the show in full splendor, presenting a world-class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm.",ontonotes5
"Er, of course, after SARS, we felt that all of Hong Kong hopes to be involved, so that the Hong Kong tourism industry will recover, rebound together with other sectors.",ontonotes5
"Hong Kong Wetland Park, which is currently under construction, is also one of the designated new projects of the Hong Kong SAR government for advancing the Hong Kong tourism industry.",ontonotes5
"This is a park intimately connected with nature, being built by the Hong Kong government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete.",ontonotes5
"Hong Kong Wetland Park covers an area of 61 hectares, including a 10,000 square meter visitor's center and a 60 hectare outdoor wildlife habitat.",ontonotes5
but behind me is our Wetland Park.,ontonotes5
"er, the Wetland Park Exploration Center.",ontonotes5
"Lastly, farthest away you can see Putian of Shenzhen.",ontonotes5
"Then, , on the bridge is Hong Kong and outside is Shenzhen.",ontonotes5
"Ah, the most special is rice, because%pw many Hong Kong children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like.",ontonotes5
Mai Po Marshes adjacent to Wetland Park is a major wildlife habitat within Asia.,ontonotes5
"Each year, over 50,000 migratory birds fly over Hong Kong's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here.",ontonotes5
"As a result, three different types of aviaries were built in Hong Kong Wetland Park.",ontonotes5
"Um, however, each year, about two to three hundred of them come to Hong Kong to spend the winter.",ontonotes5
"Some of them, er, have stayed in Hong Kong Wetland Park.",ontonotes5
Wetland Park workers are now in the middle of intensive work.,ontonotes5
"Because, as everyone knows, our Disneyland will open in September of this year.",ontonotes5
"In addition, we will have Ngong Ping 360, that is, the cable car, er, to the Giant Buddha.",ontonotes5
"They add to what we already have, like the Avenue of Stars, which is also very famous.",ontonotes5
Hong Kong's software is very well known.,ontonotes5
"In recent years, Hong Kong's tourist attractions have gradually moved from Hong Kong Island to Kowloon and the New Territory.",ontonotes5
Two out of the four new attractions participating in the 2006 Discover Hong Kong Year are located on Lantau Island of the New Territory.,ontonotes5
"For this reason, Lantau Island has become a new Hong Kong tourism popular spot.",ontonotes5
"Therefore, Hong Kong's Tian Tan Giant Buddha at the most southern tip of China, together with Lingshan Giant Buddha in the east, Leshan Giant Buddha in the west, Yungang Giant Buddha in the north, and Longmen Giant Buddha in the Central Plains, exist as the representative Buddhas for each of the five directions of China.",ontonotes5
"Since this giant bronze Buddha settled on Lantau Island, the world renowned Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok and Disneyland have also been constructed here in succession.",ontonotes5
The important status of Lantau Island is increasingly apparent.,ontonotes5
"In the near future, construction will also begin on a cross-sea bridge connecting Hong Kong, Zhuhai, and Macao.",ontonotes5
"So, after their return, Macao, and Hong Kong, the two special administrative regions, are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected.",ontonotes5
"One has to go up to Shenzhen, Dongguan, then go through Panyu, keep going up, to Zhongshan, and certainly go to Zhuhai, then pass through Zhuhai to get to Macao.",ontonotes5
"For a Hong Kong person choosing to go there via land, it's extremely inconvenient.",ontonotes5
"With this new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge that basically leads to all three places, Hong Kong, Macao, and Zhuhai, basically, at the start of the bridge, you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go.",ontonotes5
"Macao is this way, and Zhuhai is this way.",ontonotes5
"From the perspective of either Hong Kong, Macao, or Zhuhai, our concept is a tourism zone.",ontonotes5
"Er,%pw Zhuhai for sightseeing tours, Macao for entertainment, and we have Disneyland and, other attractions in Hong Kong.",ontonotes5
"So, with this bridge, when some old friends, friends from mainland China or from foreign countries come to our place, it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days, before, ha, going home.",ontonotes5
"Once the Zhuhai-Hong Kong-Macao bridge is built, it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in Macao before having fun at Disneyland just an hour later.",ontonotes5
Promotion of Hong Kong Disneyland has long since begun.,ontonotes5
"Ah, currently it has been decided that Disney will open on September 12.",ontonotes5
"Well, I am very confident, that when our tourists come to Disneyland, they will certainly return home very satisfied.",ontonotes5

"The Libyan blowing up of the Pan-Am flight had nothing to do with Israel, and I could go on and on and on.",ontonotes5
"The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional, by any standard of the word, and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years.",ontonotes5
"The 22 member countries of the Arab league, from Mauritania to the Gulf States, have a total population of 300 millions, larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion.",ontonotes5
They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe.,ontonotes5

"According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates.",ontonotes5

"Even after September 11, it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon.",ontonotes5
The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents.,ontonotes5
More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya-based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started.,ontonotes5
Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq.,ontonotes5
"One such murder, with the help of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while, as it did in Bali and in Turkey.",ontonotes5
This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World.,ontonotes5
"The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder, not the next one.",ontonotes5
Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses.,ontonotes5

Russia is beginning to understand it.,ontonotes5
Turkey understands it well.,ontonotes5
I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it.,ontonotes5
"Unfortunately, it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way.",ontonotes5
The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning.,ontonotes5
"Until Europe wakes up, this unity will not be achieved.",ontonotes5
"You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information, Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad.",ontonotes5
"You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened, and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed.",ontonotes5
"A demonstration in Berlin, carrying banners supporting Saddam's regime and featuring three-year old babies dressed as suicide murderers, is defined by the press and by political leaders as a ``peace demonstration''.",ontonotes5
"The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria, until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes.",ontonotes5
"The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia, but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and, to a smaller extent, by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations, whose goals may be noble, but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle.",ontonotes5
"You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe, not in the training camps of suicide murderers.",ontonotes5
"The Jihad ``soldiers'' join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots, while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland.",ontonotes5
"Mrs. Arafat, who lives in Paris with her daughter, receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority, while a typical local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade, reporting to Arafat, receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars, for performing murders at the retail level.",ontonotes5
All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas.,ontonotes5
"Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that someone would openly stay in a well-known address in Teheran, hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it, executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France, killing hundreds of innocent people, accepting responsibility for the crimes, promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same, while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him, invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary.",ontonotes5
"I leave it to you as homework to figur out what Spain or France would have done, in such a situation.",ontonotes5
"But before you fight and win, by force or otherwise, you have to realize that you are in a war, and this may take Europe a few more years.",ontonotes5
"I do not want to comment here on whether the American-led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument, but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia.",ontonotes5
"Now that Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are out, two and a half terrorist states remain: Iran, Syria and Lebanon, the latter being a Syrian colony.",ontonotes5
Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list.,ontonotes5
"As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq, both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them.",ontonotes5
"Iran is encircled by Afghanistan, by the Gulf States, Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union.",ontonotes5
"Syria is surrounded by Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Israel.",ontonotes5
It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq.,ontonotes5
"I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria, but that is the resulting situation.",ontonotes5
"In my humble opinion, the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime.",ontonotes5
"Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism ,",ontonotes5
"it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq ,",ontonotes5
it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia,ontonotes5
"and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium, which includes, as minor players, Syria, Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq.",ontonotes5
"Nevertheless, most European countries still trade with Iran, try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals.",ontonotes5
"No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result, if not for the train bombings a few days earlier.",ontonotes5
What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq.,ontonotes5
"The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries, including France, who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq.",ontonotes5
"In the long run, Spain itself will pay even more.",ontonotes5
"We have seen it already in Algeria and, to a certain extent, in Turkey.",ontonotes5
"On the other hand, a certain transition democracy, as in Jordan, may be a better temporary solution, paving the way for the real thing, perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China.",ontonotes5
"Or rather, Haditha's elevation as Iraq's official, bad apple atrocity.",ontonotes5
"Haditha isn't Abu Sifa where, according to Iraqi police, US forces'' on a rampage'' executed a family of 11, then bombed their house, burned their cars and slaughtered their animals.",ontonotes5
"His story was unsubstantiated and exteme, yet plausible because it was extreme, and provided a template to the pattern of force on exhibit in Iraq.",ontonotes5

"The cheers and hails of happiness at a wedding in Khan Younes in the southern Gaza Strip turned into screams and moans of pain after one of the celebrators lost control of his weapon, from which a number of bullets were released that killed the groom's brother and hit three other relatives of his, turning the wedding into a funeral in moments.",ontonotes5

"The following were among Friday's offerings and pricings in the U.S. and non-U.S. capital markets, with terms and syndicate manager, as compiled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report:",ontonotes5
There were no major Eurobond or foreign bond offerings in Europe Friday.,ontonotes5
The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds.,ontonotes5
"It also marks P&G's growing concern that its Japanese rivals, such as Kao Corp., may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S..",ontonotes5
"The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent, called Attack, which quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets.",ontonotes5
"Retailers in Phoenix, Ariz., say P&G's new powdered detergent--to be called Cheer with Color Guard--will be on shelves in that market by early November.",ontonotes5
A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month.,ontonotes5
The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack.,ontonotes5
"While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the$ 4 billion U.S. detergent market, where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders.",ontonotes5
"In the early 1980s, P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe.",ontonotes5
"But the product, which wasn't as concentrated as the new Cheer, bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped.",ontonotes5
Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S..,ontonotes5
"To be sure, Kao wouldn't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, which has about 23% of the market.",ontonotes5
"Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S., but so far the company has focused on acquisitions, such as last year's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co., a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker.",ontonotes5
It also has a product-testing facility in California.,ontonotes5
"With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening, many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.",ontonotes5
They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S..,ontonotes5
"Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.",ontonotes5
Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.,ontonotes5
He said such results should be ``measurable in dollars and cents'' in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.,ontonotes5
"But Mrs. Hills, speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday, stressed that the objective ``is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather to have a blueprint for action.''",ontonotes5
And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade.,ontonotes5
She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified.,ontonotes5
"Mrs. Hills ' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials, about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market.",ontonotes5
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years.,ontonotes5
"Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991, but the Japanese have denied making any such promise.",ontonotes5

"For instance, natural gas currently produced along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around$ 1.47 a thousand cubic feet, down 13% from$ 1.69 a thousand cubic feet a year ago.",ontonotes5
"The Bush administration, trying to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to the Soviet bloc, is questioning whether Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. supplied militarily valuable technology to the Soviets.",ontonotes5
"Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies, are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26.",ontonotes5
"To make its point, it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft.",ontonotes5
"The London Sunday Times, which first reported the U.S. concerns, cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported$ 25 million in ``embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry.''",ontonotes5
"A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom, but declined to confirm any details.",ontonotes5
"``It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting ,'' said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies.",ontonotes5
"But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc.",ontonotes5
"And if rain doesn't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas, yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced, further squeezing supplies.",ontonotes5
Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months.,ontonotes5
"By next May 31, stocks of U.S. wheat to be carried over into the next season--before the winter wheat now being planted is harvested--are projected to drop to 443 million bushels.",ontonotes5
"In response to dwindling domestic supplies, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments.",ontonotes5
"In theory at least, tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze, said Daniel Basse, a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago.",ontonotes5
"Unseasonably hot, dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season's winter wheat crop, said Conrad Leslie, a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago.",ontonotes5
"For example, in the Oklahoma panhandle, 40% or more of the topsoil is short of moisture.",ontonotes5
"That figure climbs to about 47% in wheat-growing portions of Kansas, he said.",ontonotes5
"The Soviet Union hasn't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans, but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months, further supporting prices.",ontonotes5
"``Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand'' in coming weeks, predicted Richard Feltes, vice president, research, for Refco Inc. in Chicago.",ontonotes5
"Late Thursday, after the close of trading, the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop.",ontonotes5
"However, as expected, Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about$ 1.34 a pound from around$ 1.55.",ontonotes5
Friday's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time.,ontonotes5
"Brazilian juice, after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season, is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities.",ontonotes5
"Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product, which is going to be in plentiful supply.",ontonotes5
"The price cut, one analyst said, appeared to be aimed even more at Europe, where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen.",ontonotes5
"It's a dollar-priced product, and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe, the analyst said.",ontonotes5
New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than$ 2 a pound at midyear.,ontonotes5
"Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas, downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January, when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak, the analyst said.",ontonotes5
"On European markets, meanwhile, spot prices of North Sea crudes were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel.",ontonotes5
There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and can't produce as much as it could sell.,ontonotes5
"Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies, particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria.",ontonotes5

"In announcements to workers late last week, GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants, and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories.",ontonotes5
GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.,ontonotes5
"Just a month ago, GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987.",ontonotes5
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match.,ontonotes5
"GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves: Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint, Mich.",ontonotes5
"That means two plants--one in Scarborough, Ontario, and the other in Lordstown, Ohio--probably will be shut down after the end of 1991.",ontonotes5
"The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio.",ontonotes5
"Robert White, Canadian Auto Workers union president, used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.",ontonotes5

"She transforms her ``Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria'' into the ``Babylonian Bronx ,'' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.",ontonotes5
"In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings ``glamorized'' with names like AnaMor Towers -LRB- after owners Anna and Morris Snezak -RRB-, whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii.",ontonotes5

The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF--traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts--is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.,ontonotes5
"Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC.",ontonotes5

"Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.",ontonotes5
"Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude.",ontonotes5
"Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial's system, whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region, including Chicago, Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.",ontonotes5
"Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports, said John Lichtblau, president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.",ontonotes5
"That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Lichtblau said Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East.",ontonotes5
"Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial's proposed expansion won't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude, however, since Canadian imports are limited in any case by Canada's falling output.",ontonotes5

"American investigators are going to the scene but in Washington at the White House, the Pentagon and the State Department, US officials are already expressing suspicions that today's explosion was an act of terrorism.",ontonotes5
"The blast, which occurred just after noon local time in Yemen, ripped a 20 x 40 foot gash in the USS Cole, a state-of-the-art destroyer that had stopped in Aden to refuel before joining the carrier George Washington in the Persian Gulf.",ontonotes5

"While both the Pentagon and the Justice Department today dispatched teams of experts to Yemen to investigate the explosion, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged caution saying it was too early to jump to any conclusions.",ontonotes5
"Still, she promised that the United States would take appropriate action if terrorists were found to be behind the blast, a sentiment echoed later in the day by President Clinton.",ontonotes5
"If their intention was to deter us from our mission of promoting peace and security in the Middle East, they will fail utterly.",ontonotes5
"For some terrorism experts today's attack, which occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in the Middle East, has an eerily familiar ring to it.",ontonotes5
Bruce Hoffman is the director of the Rand Corporation's Washington office.,ontonotes5
We have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in the Middle East often embroil the United States.,ontonotes5
"One only has to recall the bombing of the US Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983, also a month before presidential election, also at a time when Israel was involving suitable ferment at that point in Lebanon now with the Palestinians, where the United States was also attempting actively to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom and that seems to be the salient fact of this attack.",ontonotes5
"We have made it far more difficult, appropriately so, for terrorists to attack our ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula.",ontonotes5
"On Yemeni TV today the country's President expressed his heart-felt condolences to those who were killed and injured, but denied that the explosion on board the cole was caused by terrorists, although, admits Mohammed Al-Qadhi, editor of the Yemen Observer newspaper in the capital Sana, anti-American sentiment has been running high in Yemen because of events in the Middle East.",ontonotes5
"The people now in the streets are gathering because they feel that not just as Arabs, as human beings, that what is happening in Palestine is not humanitarian.",ontonotes5

"We have seen some more power techniques perhaps from his Foreign Minister Amre Moussa over the last few weeks, but Amre Moussa today at the Foreign Minister's meeting was calling simply for the return of East Jerusalem to the Palestinians, in stark contrast to Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shara who was pulling for a complete cut in diplomatic relations between Israel and the two Arab states that happen.",ontonotes5
So Egypt is playing a calming role.,ontonotes5
There are certainly calls for war against Israel.,ontonotes5
Egypt and Jordan do not want to see any sort of conventional war against Israel.,ontonotes5
How much is the United States entering into the conversation and how much pressure seems to be coming from the United States?,ontonotes5
I mean Madeleine Albright was in Saudi Arabia yesterday where she met with crown prince Abdullah and the new Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad.,ontonotes5
Interestingly enough she is quoted as telling General Sanholi back to the US that she did not really get too much of a reception from Bashar Al-Assad in terms of lightening the traditionally antagonistic Syrian align towards Israel.,ontonotes5
"Nonetheless, the fact that she did meet with Bashar Al-Assad and it wasn't Saudi Arabia which is traditionally being more dovish and has supported US policy, it is significant.",ontonotes5

"When Awadi and Barry performed, they managed simultaneously to bathe in the group of American hip-hop and they keep a clear sense that they are from Senegal.",ontonotes5
This connection to national and musical identities results partly from the fact that many Senegalese artists want to stay in Senegal to live and work says PBS singer Tidia Awadi.,ontonotes5

"I wasn't in a position that my dear friend was in when he was killed outside Bagdad airport but I had long thought and I was in Iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that had been about the rush to war, the push for war, the drive for war, all that propaganda, was essentially nonsensical because in 1990, Saddam Hussein made the only self criticism.",ontonotes5
"He said, I could either invade Kuwait or finish developing the nuclear weapon.",ontonotes5
"He was right about that, but that means that he inaugurated at that point like a dozen-years war where the United States could be criticized for doing too little and acting too slowly but all we're arguing about lately is to do with those that should have been finished in `91 when it could have been finished.",ontonotes5

"In the US, the money you pay for a meal at McDonald's can fill up more than 10 liters of gas, but in Beijing you can get 5-6 liters of gas at most.",ontonotes5
The US low gas price policy has undoubtedly led to this country's excessive use of and overdependence on energy resources.,ontonotes5
"However, there is more to this matter, the whole world has to share the various negative effects caused by the US excessive energy consumption: global warming, and wars caused by oil, etc.",ontonotes5
It is totally a joke that the US gas price could be cheaper than China's.,ontonotes5
2. China's gas price is too expensive.,ontonotes5
"But with the US gas price including taxes even lower than China's gas price excluding taxes, you can see how much money Chinese oil companies have made out of this.",ontonotes5
"If there are no price controls and monopolies, China's gas price shouldn't have been this high.",ontonotes5
"So, on the issue of oil consumption, I think China and the US, the No. 1 and No. 2 oil consumers in the world, are also a funny pair.",ontonotes5
China's gas prices are more complicated.,ontonotes5
"In fact, gas prices in China are probably not very high, but in order to reduce China's future overdependence on gas, it may be better that China's gas prices are higher.",ontonotes5
"But, the direct result of the gas price increase in China will be the increase of monopoly profits of the monopoly companies.",ontonotes5
"In other words, the gas price in China is too high in the distributive sense.",ontonotes5
"But in terms of sustainability, China's gas price may still be too low.",ontonotes5
Comparing McDonald's in the US with McDonald's in China may not be right.,ontonotes5
Eating a meal at McDonald's in the US is more comparable to buying a 5-yuan boxed meal in China.,ontonotes5
"While this type of tax in China has no effect on regulating the income gap or on""taking from the rich to help the poor,""neither is it beneficial in expanding the working class.",ontonotes5
"If we think in terms of humanizing the system, i.e., helping the poor by letting poor people get rich, we should give low-and moderate-income people a chance to improve and raise the quality of their lives; the threshold for China's personal income tax should be at least tripled from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month, i.e., to 6400 yuan per person.",ontonotes5
"And if we're looking at it in terms of""taking from the rich,""the problem to be adjusted is definitely not whether or not to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for distributing China's social national income, namely how to eliminate the""unreported income. """,ontonotes5
"The income of the vast majority of China's rich people is unreported income, and unreported income is a problem that Chinese society will not be able to solve for quite a long time to come; it is a characteristic of China, an uncontrollable black hole in China's social oversight.",ontonotes5
"If China's personal income tax can not achieve the effect of helping the poor to become rich, neither can it control the excessive incomes of the wealthy, so what is it we expect this personal income tax to do?",ontonotes5
1. China's income tax can not become a tool for keeping the poor perpetually poor; it can not become a social tool that keeps on producing a penniless proletariat.,ontonotes5
In China the primary function of the income tax is to increase the state's financial revenues; it is not to regulate the income gap.,ontonotes5
"In 2004 China's income taxes amounted to approximately 180 billion, accounting for about 6% of the state's financial revenues.",ontonotes5
In China more than 90% of the people who depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are urban poor.,ontonotes5
"In all of China's cities now, anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered poor.",ontonotes5
"We should not entertain any illusions that China's income tax can in any way regulate income distribution, much less that it can""take from the rich and give to the poor. """,ontonotes5
"In China, freedom, human rights, democracy, happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer refer only to 20% of the people.",ontonotes5
"Western countries that attack China for not having human rights, democracy and freedom are quite wrong; these 20% of upper-class citizens have broader human rights, democracy and freedom than do Western societies.",ontonotes5
"When God looks at China, he sees only these 20%; the other 80% he can't see clearly.",ontonotes5
"The income of the vast majority of these 20, of upper-class citizens in China is basically unreported income; the proportion of their income that comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of their wealth.",ontonotes5
Only if China eliminated unreported income would the income tax have an effect on rich people.,ontonotes5
"And if China wants to eliminate unreported income, to date there is no sign of that, and there is no compelling evidence to explain when China might eliminate unreported income.",ontonotes5
That is why the income tax has no effect on regulating the wealth of China's rich people.,ontonotes5
"The situation in China is not like that; if the personal income tax has an effect, it's to increase financial revenues, and it has absolutely no income-regulating effect.",ontonotes5
In China the wealthy will always hold 80% of the social wealth; there has never been a softhearted rich person.,ontonotes5
"In recent years China's rate of state financial growth has been higher than economic growth; this is a highly abnormal phenomenon, and in terms of economic theory it is highly adverse for sustained, healthy growth of the national economy.",ontonotes5
"This is because the former two given""fatherhood""are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new China, while the latter two dubbed""son""in this article--are indeed the ideological outcomes derived after the death of China's founder Comrade Mao Zedong under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership, which grew into today's para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up.",ontonotes5
"Regarding this, my standpoint is: because the socialism underpinned by planned economy, public ownership and the people's democratic dictatorship is indeed a really""fresh""systemic thing for China in the mid and late 20th century--without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to, no matter how scientific its kernel is, it is hard not to have certain superficial and local problems.",ontonotes5

"Rumsfeld began the conversation by saying Rumsfeld: I came to meet you to negotiate the situation in Iraq; we have made contact with some of your followers inside and outside Iraq, they have advised us to listen to you.",ontonotes5
"Your forces have occupied the territory of the proud Iraq, you have brought down the governing regime without a legal support ,",ontonotes5
"Rumsfeld: We have nothing to apologize for, you constituted a danger to your neighbors and tried to acquire weapons of mass destruction and practiced dictatorship over your people and so it was only natural that we extended our hand to the people of Iraq to rid them of the perils which had confronted them for more than three decades.",ontonotes5
"If""by our neighbors""you mean the Zionist Entity then we did indeed form a danger, we were preparing to liberate our ravished territory in Palestine.",ontonotes5
"But if you meant Kuwait, I want to ask you.",ontonotes5
Did you withdraw from Kuwait or not?,ontonotes5
"Besides, there are security agreements between us and Kuwait and the other Gulf states... we came at their request to protect them from your threats.",ontonotes5
The people of Kuwait are an Arab people.,ontonotes5
"And Kuwait is Iraqi territory, therefore I ask you to read history carefully, although I am certain that you won't comprehend it.",ontonotes5
"Saddam Hussein -LRB- interrupting -RRB-: Before you offer me your rotten goods, I ask you did you find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or not?",ontonotes5
"Saddam Hussein: We have had no weapons of mass destruction since 1991, we were truthful when we spoke with the international inspection mission, we were truthful in our letters to Kofi Annan, you knew these facts but you were looking for any pretext to occupy Iraq and topple its legitimate authority.",ontonotes5
"You are the ones who have opened the floodgates to cascades of blood on the soil of Iraq, you plotted against us and got some traitors to take over power over the land of the great Iraq.",ontonotes5
Great Iraq is being ruled by Talabani and Jaafari.,ontonotes5
"Mr Rumsfeld, we have learned from history that the occupier will not bring except his assistants and lackeys, and you want, after all that, to convince me that the people of Iraq enjoy freedom and democracy?",ontonotes5
Saddam Hussein: I challenge you to announce your location in Iraq if you can.,ontonotes5
Your men have recently carried out an ignoble operation aimed at the Abu Ghraib prison where they injured and killed more than fifty Americans and also killed a number of prisoners imprisoned under various charges.,ontonotes5

"Saddam Hussein: There is no value to a life without honor, and you robbed Iraq of its honor when you desecrated its land.",ontonotes5

"Speaking at the same time about an Iranian role in the financing and support of the war of genocide against the Sunnis.""Fadil "", a commander in the Mahdi Army tells how he had followed three Arab Sunni men for a period of some weeks and detained them when they were crossing the Karada bridge, after having informed an Iraqi army road block close to the area that he was pursuing""terrorists "", then attacked the car of the group in question.",ontonotes5
"He also told the British Guardian that he took the three men to Sadr City where his group had interrogated them then executed them, indicating that the members of the Mahdi Army usually demanded a ransom from the families of the hostages in return for freeing their relatives, and would liquidate them anyway after they receive the ransom.",ontonotes5
"The newspaper quoted another commander in the Mahdi Army as saying;""We have taken 10 Sunnis hostages, we will get a ransom for five of them, then we will kill them all. In every major hostage-taking operation we get 50 thousand dollars,""and he considered it to be the best business a person could be running in Baghdad now!",ontonotes5
"The newspaper described""Fadil""as a valuable commander to this squad because he is a Shiite who grew up in the Sunni area south of Baghdad.",ontonotes5
He speaks in the Sunni dialect and carries an identity card from the Yusufiyah Sunni village.,ontonotes5
It pointed out that Fadil and the likes are responsible for the dozens of corpses which are being found daily in Baghdad.,ontonotes5
This means that the Baghdad security plan will not be successful unless the Americans control squads such as these to put breaks on the civil war.,ontonotes5
He added that the Mahdi Army is receiving logistic and military support from Iran and that they are not encountering any problems in getting weapons through to Sadr City because they usually present a letter to each of the checkpoints they pass through.,ontonotes5

But first North Korea/.,ontonotes5
on the fourth of July North Korea tested medium and long range +missiles/.,ontonotes5
Will the United States insist that the United Nations impose sanctions against North Korea/?,ontonotes5
Well we are pursuing a very aggressive resolution up in New York at the Security Council/.,ontonotes5
We have our lead negotiator Chris Hill Ambassador Hill in Beijing Seoul and Tokyo this week/.,ontonotes5
And you know frankly we think it's time for China to use its influence with North Korea/.,ontonotes5
The Chinese have influence certainly more than the United States and the other members of the international community dealing with this problem/.,ontonotes5
"China now has an opportunity to put its best foot forward, to send the North Koreans a direct message that these missile tests can not be tolerated and the North Koreans now have to come back to the September nineteenth two thousand five agreement and they've got to denuclearize give up their nuclear ambitions and abide by the agreement that they made with the rest of us nearly a year ago/.",ontonotes5
But the South Koreans and the Chinese have both said they do not believe there should be sanctions against North Korea/.,ontonotes5
Will the US absolutely insist that there be sanctions in the UN resolution/?,ontonotes5
If you look at this UN resolution that's under debate in New York it does/.,ontonotes5
It does ask all member states not to engage in nuclear trade with North Korea/.,ontonotes5
but our view is that the five parties ought to remain united and that the goal of the current diplomacy should be to use the combined leverage of China and Russia's of South Korea Japan and the United States to force the North Koreans back to the negotiating table/.,ontonotes5
That's certainly the best policy for the United States/.,ontonotes5
there are many as you know Mister Ambassador who believe the North Koreans did this launch on the fourth of July to get our attention Because they saw the way we were treating Iran differently than we were treating North Korea/.,ontonotes5
With Iran the United States has made an offer/.,ontonotes5
and that is we are willing to sit down and negotiate with the Iranians assuming and contingent upon their suspension of their nuclear activities at their plant in the in Iran/.,ontonotes5
We've been saying for months now that the right step forward is for North Korea to return to these talks/.,ontonotes5
but we really don't see the logic in turning this into a test of wills between two countries the United States and North Korea/.,ontonotes5
The fact is that China has the same interest as the United States/.,ontonotes5
And that is to stop the North Korea nuclear program/.,ontonotes5
Our allies Japan and South Korea have the same interests/.,ontonotes5
And so we think we're far better off working within the framework of the six party talks because you get in that process the combined leverage the combined strength and frankly the combined pressure on North Korea of all these different countries/.,ontonotes5
I simply don't see why it's in the interest of the United States to get those countries out of the way and only deal with North Korea directly/.,ontonotes5
So the problem here is not the lack of discussion between the United States and North Korea/.,ontonotes5
and in that sense it's analogous to what we're trying to do with Iran/.,ontonotes5
So really you know the North Korea problem is not a problem just for the United States/.,ontonotes5
What they did the other day on July fourth was to disrupt the peace and harmony of their relations with the Asian countries/.,ontonotes5

Is it the policy of the Bush administration that we 'd like to see regime change in North Korea/?,ontonotes5
It crashed in the sea of Japan/.,ontonotes5
Will the United States give North Korea security assurances that we will not attack their country or seek to undermine their regime/?,ontonotes5
And what we've seen since then is we've seen the United States and Russia and China and Japan and South Korea willing to go forward willing to sit down willing to implement this entire agreement that you just referred to Tim/.,ontonotes5
But we would be willing to give North Korea increased economic aid perhaps light nuclear reactors for peaceful means and security assurance if in fact they sat down and negotiated/?,ontonotes5
and it's very specific about what the United States is willing to do uh to take a step forward towards them should they dismantle all their nuclear programs and their weapons of mass destruction/.,ontonotes5
They can't just think that they can sit down with the United States alone/.,ontonotes5
That doesn't work for Japan/.,ontonotes5
it doesn't work with South Korea/.,ontonotes5
And Chris Hill our ambassador was in China a few days ago/.,ontonotes5
"he made the point and Secretary Rice made the point yesterday to the Chinese Foreign minister, we want to see China use its influence/.",ontonotes5
We want to see China push forward and ask the North Koreans to meet these commitments that they've made to all of us/.,ontonotes5
"The time to replace the state department's failed North Korea strategy of talk forever, act never has come/.",ontonotes5
For thirteen years the United States has talked loudly about a North Korea nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threat/.,ontonotes5
America's actions must be decisive or faced with a brutal totalitarian dictatorship about which we know little/.,ontonotes5
or we the United States should dismantle it/.,ontonotes5
So obviously we're going to pursue a very tough very decisive policy over the coming weeks designed to focus the North Koreans on their obligations To pressure them to come back to the talks But also certainly to provide for our own defense and the defense of our treaty allies in Asia/.,ontonotes5
Uh Mister Ambassador many critics will say the six years George Bush has been president North Korea's program has developed rather dramatically That the policy at first of isolation and then the six party talk just hasn't worked/.,ontonotes5
They estimated a report that North Korea has enough separated plutonium to develop now an arsenal of four to thirteen nuclear weapons compared with estimates of just one or two weapons in two thousand when George bush became president/.,ontonotes5
The group says that by two thousand eight North Korea could have enough plutonium for eight to seventeen nuclear weapons/.,ontonotes5
although the Bush administration's rhetoric about Kim Jong-Il and his regime has sometimes seemed ferocious North Korea's leaders seem to have concluded that the Bush North Korea policy consists mainly of empty words and that oft repeated warning need not be taken terribly seriously/.,ontonotes5
Would you acknowledge a significant increase in the nuclear capability by North Korea on the watch of President Bush/?,ontonotes5
Eh you know we've got a very strong military force and deterrent force at work in Asia and particularly on the Korean peninsula/.,ontonotes5
The fact is that a lot of this criticism seems to direct the United States back to a test of wills bilaterally between North Korea and the United States/.,ontonotes5
What we want to do is we want to ask countries that do have a great deal of influence on North Korea certainly more than we have to use that influence/.,ontonotes5
we certainly understand the gravity of a challenge posed by North Korea/.,ontonotes5
But you do not deny that North Korea's nuclear capability has increased during the presidency of George Bush/?,ontonotes5
Well North Korea says that it has a nuclear weapons capability/.,ontonotes5
It will effectively de-nuclearize North Korea/.,ontonotes5
And so that is a good bet for the United States/.,ontonotes5
Here's the President Friday at this news conference in Chicago about North Korea/.,ontonotes5
North Korea has a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction While starving its citizens/.,ontonotes5
The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons/.,ontonotes5
Since the President uttered those words Mister Ambassador every estimate is that North Korea has doubled its capacity to develop nuclear weapons/.,ontonotes5
We have to try to draw a net around the fact that North Korea is the leading exporter of ballistic missile technology around the world The proliferator of it/.,ontonotes5
And we've created and driven forward this diplomatic coalition designed to bring us to a victory in denying North Korea the nuclear weaponry that you talk about/.,ontonotes5
We have not given up on this quest to come to the end of these negotiations and put the North Koreans back into a place where they can no longer be a threat to their neighbors or to the United States/.,ontonotes5
Let me go back and review some of the things the President has said about Kim Jong-Il of North Korea/.,ontonotes5
And then in two thousand four there's a tyrant in North Korea that wants to develop a nuclear weapon/.,ontonotes5
And so uh we haven't changed our opinion of the nature of the regime in North Korea/.,ontonotes5
So I think there's been a lot of continuity over American policy both in the substance of the policy and in the way we've talked about North Korea over the last several years/.,ontonotes5
When the president talked about the axis of evil he said Iraq North Korea and Iran/.,ontonotes5
The United States invaded one of those countries Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Some now make the case that Iran and North Korea took from that the following lesson that if you develop a nuclear bomb and have a strong military you will not be invaded by the US/.,ontonotes5
They thought that they could divide the United States from both our European allies and from Russia and China/.,ontonotes5
And you'll see a lot of this unfold this week both in Europe when Secretary Rice meets with her counterparts on Wednesday at the GA summit in St. Petersburgh At the end of the week when the president is there/.,ontonotes5
And it's the right way to go clearly for the United States/.,ontonotes5
Based on our experience in Iraq particularly with our emphasis on the weapons of mass destruction that did not materialize John Deutch the former head of the CIA offered this observation/.,ontonotes5
the next time military intervention is judged necessary to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction for example North Korea there will be skepticism about the quality of our intelligence/.,ontonotes5
not in the case of North Korea not in the case of Iran/.,ontonotes5
Tim I've been to Europe twenty times over the last fourteen months to talk to the Europeans and the Russians and Chinese about Iran for instance/.,ontonotes5
There's not a single person at the higher levels of those government who doesn't believe Iran is trying to create a nuclear weapons capability/.,ontonotes5
There isn't a single person in the governments of China or Russia or South Korea or Japan who doesn't believe that North Korea is bent on building up its nuclear capability/.,ontonotes5
There is no argument in the real world today about what these two countries Iran and North Korea are trying to do/.,ontonotes5
There is no argument remotely similar to what we went through in two thousand and two and three with our European allies over Iraq/.,ontonotes5
So I don't agree at all that we're somehow limited in what we can do and limited in our effectiveness because of the disagreements that we had over WMD in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
North Korea is firing missiles/.,ontonotes5
Iran is going nuclear/.,ontonotes5
Somalia is controlled by radical Islamists/.,ontonotes5
Iraq isn't getting better/.,ontonotes5
and Afghanistan is getting worse/.,ontonotes5
I give the President a lot of credit for hanging tough on Iraq/.,ontonotes5
Have a preoccupation with Iraq allowed North Korea and Iran to go forward with their nuclear programs and limited our options/?,ontonotes5
Uh Secretary Rumsfeld was in Afghanistan this morning/.,ontonotes5
Coming next the view of three former Clinton Administration officials who spent years dealing with the North Korea problem former Assistant Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter chief State Department negotiator now at the Georgetown University Robert Gallucci And former US ambassador to the UN now Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson/.,ontonotes5
Governor Richardson should the United States negotiate directly one on one with North Korea/?,ontonotes5
Uh what you have is North Korea has quadrupled its enriched plutonium since two thousand and two/.,ontonotes5
Uh the successes we've had with the North Koreans have been through direct engagement When I got some pilots out of North Korea When Bob Gallucci negotiated the agreed framework/.,ontonotes5
What North Korea is seeing right now is Iran getting a nuclear reactor/.,ontonotes5
They see Iran getting a nuclear fuel cycle that is assured economic incentives/.,ontonotes5
On the other hand what they want to see is treated with respect direct talks with the United States/.,ontonotes5
But also they want to see an effort by the United States to give them the recognition that they feel they deserve/.,ontonotes5
It makes sense to talk directly with North Korea/.,ontonotes5
you get the US attention/.,ontonotes5
Uh Asia is destabilized/.,ontonotes5
We are trying to outsource our foreign policy to China/.,ontonotes5
I believe China is not necessarily interested in helping us on North Korea/.,ontonotes5
I believe that China is a competitor/.,ontonotes5
Right now we do not have leverage over China/.,ontonotes5
Get that agreement that was uh signed in September that North Korea has not abided to/.,ontonotes5
A time table for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons/.,ontonotes5
Efforts to set up bench marks in exchange for that armistice agreement where we don't attack North Korea/.,ontonotes5
I believe the headlines would be Bush deals realistically with North Korea/.,ontonotes5
Uh uh the virtue of having all these parties in Asia engaged that's/-,ontonotes5
And the fact that you may get a headline like the President is reversing course as indeed we have in the case of Iran that's not so bad if you find you're on the wrong course/.,ontonotes5
Ashton Carter do you agree there should be one on one direct negotiations between North Korea and the US/?,ontonotes5
The reason to have everybody at the table with the North Koreans is not only that they have a stake in the outcome as well but uh in dealing with North Korea diplomacy has to have a coercive dimension/.,ontonotes5
And we don't trade with North Korea/.,ontonotes5
we don't recognize North Korea diplomatically/.,ontonotes5
uh there's almost nothing we can do short of military action to apply pressure to North Korea/.,ontonotes5
One camp which believes that we have to give diplomacy a try and is earnest about pursuing diplomacy with North Korea/.,ontonotes5
I don't agree with that view because I think it's more immoral to let North Korea go nuclear than to try to reach a deal with North Korea/.,ontonotes5
you showed some of that ambivalence in the earlier part of your segment where you see the US government saying one thing at one time and another thing at the other times/.,ontonotes5
and perhaps could even trigger a North Korea response against South Korea or against Japan/.,ontonotes5
And to those that think that's too much I can only say where are you going to draw a line in the sand with North Korea/?,ontonotes5
but I have to emphasize there's risk in inaction as well letting North Korea go nuclear/.,ontonotes5
"I think if we are seriously attacked or threatened, that missile which was a test was geared to the United States or to our allies we have allied responsibilities with South Korea or Japan/./.",ontonotes5
but the fact is that you risk uh the uh North Koreans shooting missiles at South Korea/.,ontonotes5
Which by the way I believe you could have a separate bilateral face to face negotiation with the United States and also continue the efforts with the six party talks because it is the South Koreans and the Japanese that are providing financial and fuel incentives/.,ontonotes5
but I think it's essential to have face to *face private bilateral talks between United States and North Korea/.,ontonotes5
Uh my point is that when you deal with North Korea you're not dealing with individuals like you and me/.,ontonotes5
My point is that face to face discussions with the United States directly I believe is a precursor/.,ontonotes5
Here's Madeline Albright toasting Kim Jong-Il in North Korea October of two thousand/.,ontonotes5
But didn't North Korea develop a nuclear bomb on Bill Clinton's watch/?,ontonotes5
We think they started cheating in the late nineties by getting some gas centrifuge equipment from Pakistan/.,ontonotes5
North Korea can not be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb/.,ontonotes5
We will not tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea/.,ontonotes5
I do think and here I agree with both of the other gentlemen you have on the show who have shown it's possible to reach an agreement with North Korea and to get agreements that serve our interests The much maligned agreed framework as Bob Galluci pointed out without that agreed framework North Korea by all the calculations of the experts would now have fifty nuclear weapons/.,ontonotes5
I was in North Korea when that happened/.,ontonotes5
In exchange for North Korea dismantling its nuclear weapons its missiles they get an armistice agreement where they are not attacked/.,ontonotes5
My point is if it's just going to be a face to face meeting that serves as a precursor that also deals with this frozen assets issue which has directly hit the North Korean regime cause it controls the foreign expenditures of Kim Jong-Il and you deal with this light water reactor especially now after we've promised it to Iran and economic incentives to Iran I think the timing is right for this new stage of direct negotiation/.,ontonotes5
It's a good idea it was in nineteen ninety four to do a deal with the North that required them to give up the program/.,ontonotes5
"So you have the possibility if the North Koreans are thinking the way they may be thinking that they need one or the other, they need either nuclear weapons to deter the United States from regime change or they need a relationship with us that makes it unnecessary for them to have nuclear weapons/.",ontonotes5
Uh what that causes unfortunately is an isolated North Korea/.,ontonotes5
Iraq in the shadows/.,ontonotes5
Has Iraq been overshadowed by Katrina and Tom DeLay and Harriet Meyers and the Pakistan quake/?,ontonotes5
And joining us now in Los Angeles Arianna Huffington the syndicated columnist and founder of the blog huffington post dot com/.,ontonotes5
in Minneapolis Lucy Dalglish executive director of the Reporters ' Committee for Freedom of the Press/.,ontonotes5
and here in Washington Frank Sesno professor of public policy and communication at George Mason University and a CNN special correspondant/.,ontonotes5
She was pulled off of certain stories on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction/.,ontonotes5
Judy Miller acknowledges that at Louis Libby's request this is the Dick Cheney aide she agreed to refer to him and in stories not as a senior administration official but as a former Hill aide because he had once worked on Capitol Hill/.,ontonotes5
I mean her justification was that well he had been a former Hill staffer/.,ontonotes5
You know news organizations demand total transparency whether you're General Motors or United States government/.,ontonotes5
After all these notes were just a few weeks old when um the Valerie Plame Bob Novak column appeared and when the whole Washington and the whole journalistic community was talking about it/.,ontonotes5
And that is the whole notion of the use of and abuse of confidential sources the protections that reporters do or don't have and the propensity of uh the United States government to have more secrecy not less/.,ontonotes5
When we come back media speculation run amuck over possible indictments at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania and the President's scripted session with troops in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
what we have speculated is that it might be a much more tangled web that Fitzgerald is after the whole Iraq White House group the group that uh in Cheney's office with Libby and Rove and Mary Matalin and Condoleezza Rice and a lot of administration officials basically sold um a war to the American public based on lies/.,ontonotes5
The fact of the matter is that there are lots of people in Washington and believe me they're not all journalists who are speculating what if the guy gets indicted/.,ontonotes5
Alright I want to turn now to uh President Bush's uh meeting uh uh photo op some called it with US troops in Iraq whether it was staged how shocking that would be/.,ontonotes5
And in your interactions with the Iraqi civilians in Tikrit Saddam's hometown how are they reacting to this political process/?,ontonotes5
Sir in the north central area of Iraq voter registration has increased seventeen percent/.,ontonotes5
Can you give us a sense for the reception of the people there in Tikrit/?,ontonotes5
Sir in north central Iraq voter regis-/-,ontonotes5
and what the problem this now creates for the White House is {is} it plays into the credibility issue that the President has that everything now is becoming a photo op and a rehearsed event in order to rescue what are tumbling numbers on his performance on public support of Iraq the whole bit/.,ontonotes5
Arianna Huffington Lucy Dalglish in Minneapolis Frank Sesno thanks so very much for joining us/.,ontonotes5
Among his criticisms the former president's handling of the nineteen ninety-six Khobar Towers terrorist bombing that killed nineteen US marines in Saudi Arabia/.,ontonotes5
I was very disappointed that the political leadership of the United States uh would tell the families of these nineteen heroes that we were going to leave no stone unturned and find the people who killed them/.,ontonotes5
"Louis Freeh says that when Clinton met with Crown Prince Abdullah in nineteen ninety-eight, he didn't press for FBI access to suspects in the Khobar Towers bombing and he hit up the prince for a contribution to his presidential library/.",ontonotes5
and the only way that that can be countered is a former president of the United States/?,ontonotes5
When did the Clinton team find out that Sixty Minutes was going to report that Louis Freeh with his new book was going to have a specific allegation about Clinton's handling of the Khobar Towers investigation and the business about the presidential library solicitation/.,ontonotes5
Jay Carson is the spokesperson for President Clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the Khobar Towers which happens to be not true/.,ontonotes5

What's so frustrating about the Iraq story Howie no one has a bird's eye view/.,ontonotes5
There's a lot of good things going on in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
And that's why we get surprises in Iraq/.,ontonotes5
pulling back the camera a bit in recent months you 'd have to say that the Iraq story has been overshadowed by Katrina by Rita by Tom DeLay by Harriet Miers by Valerie Plame and now by this Pakistan earthquake/.,ontonotes5
but at the end of the day the Bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to Iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there/.,ontonotes5
And going back again to one of your Iraq collumns uh you observed the Iraqi military there which after all is supposed to be increasingly shouldering the burden of this conflict/.,ontonotes5

You quoted one US senior official and what the President of the United States and the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense are saying to reporters every day/.,ontonotes5
Here's what you learn when you go to Iraq/.,ontonotes5
The navy of Iraq has a terrific commander/.,ontonotes5

"Today, let's turn our attention to a road cave-in accident that happened in Beijing over the holiday.",ontonotes5
"Before dawn on January 3, a sewage pipe leakage accident occurred at the main and side roads of Jingguang Bridge, East Third Ring Road, Beijing Municipality, resulting in the road caving in.",ontonotes5
Relevant departments from Beijing Municipality promptly activated emergency contingency plans.,ontonotes5
The station called me at noon and said something happened at Jingguang Bridge and that I had to go to the station immediately to research the upcoming program.,ontonotes5
"I remember the SMS was written like this at that time, saying that, ah, there was a sewage pipe leakage accident on the side road at the southeast corner of Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road, and, well, traffic supervision was implemented near Chaoyang Road, Jingguang Bridge, and East Third Ring Road, and requesting cars to make a detour.",ontonotes5
"Ah, after the SMS was sent, , I felt it seems to be the first time that Beijing Municipality, ah, used an SMS to give notification at the time of a public emergency.",ontonotes5
"I don't know, all of us are living in Beijing, is this the first time, Professor Zhou?",ontonotes5
"Actually, I remember receiving an SMS like this one last year before it snowed, since snowfall would affect road conditions in Beijing to a rather large extent.",ontonotes5
"We drive often in Beijing, ha, Yang Yang.",ontonotes5
"Furthermore, I think that when SMS was used to announce the news, it should be said to have fit the conditions in our China very well.",ontonotes5
"This is because, it should be said that China is the country with the highest SMS usage.",ontonotes5
"There are probably not as many chances to use SMS in foreign countries compared with domestically, in China, ah.",ontonotes5
I saw it was that Jingguang Bridge.,ontonotes5
"Well, lots of barricade tape has been strung up on the side road in the north-south direction of the accident scene beneath the Jingguang Bridge at East Third Ring Road.",ontonotes5
"Actually, concerning this, I think both of you are very familiar with the traffic in Beijing.",ontonotes5
"Previously we had a statistic, especially for the ring roads in Beijing.",ontonotes5
"That is, if we have an ordinary fender bender or tailgate accident on a bridge such as the Jingguang Bridge of the Third Ring Road, it might cause the entire Third Ring Road to have bumper-to-bumper traffic jams during these morning and evening peak periods.",ontonotes5
It might even impact traffic on the Second Ring Road and Fourth Ring Road.,ontonotes5
"Well, we could not imagine imposing temporary traffic restriction measures on a long section of road stretching from Jingguang Bridge to Changhong Bridge from the south all the way to Guomao Bridge, blocking the main and side roads.",ontonotes5
"However, actually after the entire day today, I came here right after ending the live broadcast this evening to continue with the live broadcast here, in fact, in Beijing today people indeed experienced an extremely high volume of traffic flow on the roads surrounding the section under traffic control, and indeed there was a very big traffic jam.",ontonotes5
"A friend said, I work on the 12th floor of the China World Trade Center at the Guomao Bridge, ah.",ontonotes5
"Later on, we suggested to him and said, you, ah, might as well take the subway, because you can directly reach the subway once you get down from the China World Trade Center.",ontonotes5
"Yes, many, viewers not in Beijing may not be quite familiar, ah, with this road section we just mentioned, where, ah, the accident occurred.",ontonotes5
"This road represents a main road on East Third Ring Road, with problems on both the main and side roads.",ontonotes5
"Furthermore, Chaoyang Road is an intersection.",ontonotes5
"Whether it is Chaoyang Road in the east-west direction or the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road in the south-north direction, as we can see from this diagram, it can be said that the area at the main and side roads of East Third Ring Road normally has quite heavy traffic, especially during commuting times.",ontonotes5
"Well, Chaoyang Road is a very important artery in the east-west direction.",ontonotes5
"Yes, actually I think everyone can see that from the buses that cross Jingguang Bridge.",ontonotes5
"As buses that cross the Third Ring Road are currently, right now affected by the Jingguang Bridge accident, ah, the latest results this morning show that 32 bus routes throughout the neighborhood have had to be rerouted.",ontonotes5
"In this way, all vehicles going along East Third Ring Road had to make a detour to go on roads on the east and west sides.",ontonotes5
East Third Ring Road is a traffic artery in the east of Beijing that links the north and the south.,ontonotes5
"We set up traffic diversion points at 68 locations along East Second Ring Road, East Fourth Ring Road, West Dawang Road, ah, and related roads to the east and west, and deployed more than 210 additional police officers to divert and direct traffic.",ontonotes5
"Well, from this footage, we can see that, ha, at East Third Ring Road, ah, near Guanghua Bridge, the roads here that lead to the vicinity of Jingguang Bridge have come under control and, well, various kinds of signs have also been placed at very conspicuous locations.",ontonotes5
"Although the outdoor temperature in Beijing has fallen to minus 3 degrees, the traffic police deployed additional manpower on the roads to direct traffic, ah, and guide drivers in making detours.",ontonotes5
"Since we know that Jingguang Bridge is located in the CBD district, well there are many office buildings, ah, a lot of them, as well as quite a lot of friends who get up early in the morning to go to work.",ontonotes5
"I think that this mentality in facing emergencies, in one respect shows a great change of mentality that Beijing citizens now have after enduring several tests in the past, and a kind of calmness and maturity after having experienced frustrations.",ontonotes5
"However, this time, through the execution of emergency contingency plans by Beijing Municipality this time, ah, it should be said that the response speed of the different departments of Beijing Municipality, as well as the integrated emergency mechanisms, played a great role.",ontonotes5
"For instance, it is very cold during winter in Beijing, and the temperature last night dropped to one of the lowest points recently.",ontonotes5
"Well, at the time, it affected residents living in an area of about 70,000 square meters of Beijing.",ontonotes5
"Well, , in this regard, the Chaoyang district government did a very good job.",ontonotes5
"Professor Zhou, actually for such a large scale city as Beijing that has more than 14 million people, ah, for such a big city, a suddenly occurring public emergency like this should be said to be relatively common.",ontonotes5
"Yes, I think through a few incidents that happened in Beijing Municipality over recent years, such as SARS, the snowfall a few years ago, the heavy rains two years ago, and the road cave-in at East Third Ring Road this time, I think it can be seen that Beijing Municipality's response capabilities continued to improve each time.",ontonotes5
"It is because, we, Beijing Traffic Radio Station, has become a part of emergency planning in Beijing.",ontonotes5
Beijing Municipality still had no emergency plan.,ontonotes5
"I think, in comparison to China, we should say that urbanization in foreign countries developed earlier and is more widespread.",ontonotes5
"Well, finally, let's turn our attention to handling of the situation, ah, during the latter stages of the cave-in accident in Beijing.",ontonotes5
"Okay, well, today both of you have come to the studio and given us a lot of specific details concerning this road cave-in accident in Beijing Municipality.",ontonotes5
"We see that except for some areas of South China, Southwest China, and Northeast China, many other places will be experiencing temperature drops.",ontonotes5
"In addition, there will be snowfall in the area from Northwest China to the Huang-Huai area through southern North China.",ontonotes5
"The east of Southwest China, as well as the Jiang-Huai area and the area south of the Yangtze River, will experience continuous rainfall.",ontonotes5
"However, southern North China and the Huang-Huai area will bid farewell to the snow tonight, ah.",ontonotes5
"Tomorrow during the day, snowfall in the Jiang-Huai area will stop, and there will also be less snow in Northwest China.",ontonotes5
"In addition, there will be rain throughout almost the whole of South China.",ontonotes5
"Furthermore, temperatures tomorrow in many places south of the Huai River will fall by between four and ten degrees.",ontonotes5

"With 3,000 Taiwan-owned businesses here, and 10-20,000 Taiwanese business people and their dependants coming in and out every day, the Dong-guan area has already developed an economic circle in which Taiwan firms can conduct most of their business among themselves.",ontonotes5

"Many Taiwanese believe that at a time of cross-strait tension, Taiwan firms have made their own decisions to invest in the mainland and therefore should bear the risk themselves too.",ontonotes5
"And by investing their money, technology and so forth on the mainland, are they not to some degree abandoning Taiwan?",ontonotes5

"Hence, he argues that it's very unfair to say that Taiwanese businesses in the mainland aren't contributing to Taiwan.",ontonotes5
"The question is, how should the ROC government view Taiwan firms in the mainland?",ontonotes5

TBAD's spiritual leader H.D. Yeh often goes to Beijing to represent Taiwan firms in negotiations with the government.,ontonotes5
"Once, in the presence of many Communist Party cadres, a high-ranking official of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office asked him this question:""You've gathered so many Taiwan firms in Dongguan and stirred up such enthusiasm among them-but for what purpose? """,ontonotes5

"In Taiwan, in recent years the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the National Science Council and the National Health Research Institutes have been strongly pursuing""biochip""research programs.",ontonotes5
"In the last two years, three biochip companies have also been set up in Taiwan.",ontonotes5
What is the current state of this field in Taiwan?,ontonotes5
"As part of the government's efforts to promote the biotechnology industry in Taiwan, in July 1999 the Industrial Technology Research Institute -LRB- ITRI -RRB- set up the Biomedical Engineering Center -LRB- BMEC -RRB- to actively develop biomedical engineering technologies.",ontonotes5
"As well as this new research establishment, in the two years since September 1998 three commercial companies have been set up in Taiwan to make biochips: U-Vision Biotech, Taiwan Genome Sciences and DR. Chip Biotechnology.",ontonotes5
"Of these, DR. Chip attracted much attention this year when it developed a chip to detect enteroviruses, a deadly epidemic of which has gripped Taiwan over the last two years.",ontonotes5
"Johnsee Lee says that according to US market research estimates, the worldwide annual consumption of microarray chips is currently around 250,000; in two years this is expected to grow to 1.2 million.",ontonotes5
"Thus some people have set their sights on the biochip market, and believe that following Taiwan's success in the semiconductor field, the island could go on to be a major center for contract manufacture of biochips.",ontonotes5
"Be that as it may, the small number of biochip companies so far established in Taiwan still find their market in domestic research establishments and pharmaceuticals manufacturers.",ontonotes5
"Jerry Huang, executive vice president of U-Vision Biotech, reveals that U-Vision, which was set up in September 1999, has signed a contract with the US company Zen-Bio to jointly develop human adipocyte cDNA microarray chips.",ontonotes5
"CEO Andrew Kuo says the investors came to the view that Taiwan needs to develop its biotechnology industries, and therefore they combined their resources to make a long-term investment in the field.",ontonotes5
"TGS's strategy is to invest in a number of US genome research companies, and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with them.",ontonotes5
"Currently, TGS has its sights set mainly on doing research into diseases which are especially prevalent in Asia, such as liver and stomach cancers.",ontonotes5
"Can Taiwan really repeat its success in the semiconductor industry, to become a major production center for biochips?",ontonotes5
"However, due to Taiwan's early entry into biochip research and development, and the high state of development of its semiconductor industry, the island is well supplied with relevant technology and skills.",ontonotes5

"Lee added that he hoped the Advisory Group would shortly come to a firm conclusion on the""one China""issue.",ontonotes5
"Furthermore, DPP chairman Frank Hsieh himself came under fire within the party after stating:""The constitution of the ROC is itself a one China framework.",ontonotes5
"According to DPP lawmaker Lin Cho-shui, Chen Shui-bian has shown more goodwill to Beijing as president than Lee Teng-hui ever did, but without any response -",ontonotes5
"so why should he once again be expected to respond on the""one China""issue?",ontonotes5
"On November 24 the New Party, which had already pulled out of the Advisory Group, published an article in the press signed by leading members such as Yu Mu-ming and Chen Kui-miao, in which they called on the government to take the constitution as its starting point for breaking the""one China""deadlock.",ontonotes5
"For the first time Wang voiced support for Lee Yuan-tseh's proposal that""with ' one China ' as the precondition, each side can have its own interpretation. """,ontonotes5

"A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier's knack for making life sound simple, Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week, days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital Grozny.",conll2003

Wall Street ponders Rubin's role if Clinton wins.,conll2003
NEW YORK,conll2003
The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected.,conll2003
Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week.,conll2003
"Should Rubin leave, Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him.",conll2003
"Rubin's predecessor at the Treasury, Lloyd Bentsen, was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan.",conll2003
""" Obviously, under the Clinton administration, we've seen two distinctively different dollar policies,""said Chris Widness, an international economist at Chase Securities Inc.""Under Rubin, the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar. """,conll2003
"Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar's comeback, using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street, part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs and Co.",conll2003
Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening.,conll2003
""" Although, if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation, it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States,""said Widness, adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and, to a lesser degree, bonds.",conll2003
"If that is true, then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency.",conll2003

"In June, the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector.",conll2003
Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks.,conll2003
"Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore,""however, this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region. """,conll2003
"From a commercial point of view, the meeting would be good for Singapore's tourism industry, Tan said.",conll2003
